## Overview

The **Blessings Reservoir (BR)** is Mythara's core construct for measuring **cumulative benevolent force**. It tracks acts of obedience under paradox, translating sacred work into measurable infrastructure.

This guide shows faith organizations how to integrate the Soul Cradle Operator with their existing systems to accumulate and report Blessings.

---

## Conceptual Model

### What is a "Blessing"?
A Blessing is a **unit of benevolent force** generated when an individual or organization:
1. **Obeys sacred principles** (Commandments, mission values)
2. **Under conditions of paradox** (conflicting obligations, impossible constraints)
3. **With compassionate intent** (not merely procedural compliance)

### Formula
```
ΔBlessings = f(Integrity, Difficulty, Compassion)

Where:
  Integrity = Cradle(S, W, C) → I ∈ [0, 1]
  Difficulty = measure of constraint (resource scarcity, emotional burden)
  Compassion = qualitative scorer (human judgment or sentiment analysis)

For Obedience:
  ΔBlessings = +round(I × Difficulty × Compassion × 100)

For Disobedience:
  ΔBlessings = -round((1-I) × Severity × Harm × 100)

Cumulative Reservoir:
  BR(t) = BR(t-1) + ΔBlessings
```

---

## Integration Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Sacred Acts
Map your organization's core mission activities to BR-trackable events.

**Example: St. Jude Children's Research Hospital**
| Sacred Act | Description | Typical BR Impact |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Pediatric cancer treatment | Administering chemotherapy to child with 20% survival odds | +15 to +25 |
| Family grief counseling | Supporting parents after child's death | +10 to +15 |
| Experimental protocol enrollment | Offering cutting-edge trial as last hope | +20 to +30 |
| Donor act of generosity | Individual donates despite personal financial hardship | +25 to +35 |
| Staff emotional resilience | Nurse returns to care after witnessing multiple child deaths | +8 to +12 |

### Step 2: Configure BR Triggers
Connect Mythara API to your existing systems (EMR, CRM, HR).

**Technical Flow:**
```
[Your System Event] 
  → Webhook/API call to Mythara 
  → Soul Cradle computes Integrity 
  → BR updates with ΔBlessings 
  → Response includes integrity_hash (SHA-256)
```

**Example API Call:**
```bash
POST https://api.mythara.ai/v1/soul/cradle
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "soul_state": 0.68,
  "will_description": "Heal this child despite terminal prognosis",
  "commandment_context": "Do no harm, preserve life, comfort family",
  "paradox_severity": 0.85,
  "metadata": {
    "org_id": "st-jude",
    "event_type": "treatment_protocol",
    "patient_id_hash": "sha256:abc123...",
    "staff_role": "oncology_nurse"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "integrity_score": 0.74,
  "alignment": 0.82,
  "tolerance": 0.90,
  "br_delta": +18,
  "cumulative_br": 47328,
  "integrity_hash": "sha256:d4f7e9a1...",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-15T14:32:10Z"
}
```

### Step 3: Privacy Safeguards
Mythara **never stores PHI** (Protected Health Information) or personally identifiable data.

**What We Store:**
- Aggregate BR totals by organization
- Integrity scores by event type (anonymized)
- SHA-256 hashes for audit trails

**What We Don't Store:**
- Patient names, medical record numbers, diagnoses
- Staff performance reviews, individual compliance scores
- Donor identities, financial account details

**Hashing Strategy:**
```python
# Your system generates a one-way hash before sending to Mythara
import hashlib

patient_id = "12345-MRN"
patient_id_hash = hashlib.sha256(patient_id.encode()).hexdigest()

# Send only the hash to Mythara
metadata = {"patient_id_hash": patient_id_hash}
```

## Use Cases by Organization Type

### Healthcare (Hospitals, Hospice, Palliative Care)
**Sacred Acts to Track:**
- End-of-life care conversations (high paradox: prolong life vs. reduce suffering)
- Experimental treatments with low success probability
- Staff emotional labor during mass casualty events
- Chaplain services during terminal diagnoses

**BR Reporting:**
- Monthly board reports: "This month, 2,340 acts of compassionate care accumulated 38,400 Blessings"
- Donor communications: "Your gift enabled 47 families to receive grief counseling, generating 640 Blessings"

---

### Disaster Relief (Catholic Charities, Salvation Army, Red Cross)
**Sacred Acts to Track:**
- Serving meals when demand exceeds supply (paradox: feed 500 when 5,000 are hungry)
- Shelter provision during resource scarcity
- Staff resilience after witnessing trauma
- Volunteer acts of service under extreme conditions

**BR Reporting:**
- Grant applications: "Despite 40% funding shortfall, our mission integrity remained above 0.75, accumulating 120,000 Blessings across 8,500 service events"
- Volunteer recognition: "Your 200 hours of service this year generated 3,200 Blessings for families in crisis"

---

### Education (Faith-Based Schools, Youth Programs)
**Sacred Acts to Track:**
- Teaching students with severe learning disabilities (paradox: standardized testing vs. individual growth)
- Mentorship during student mental health crises
- Financial aid decisions (paradox: limited scholarships, unlimited need)
- Retention efforts for at-risk youth

**BR Reporting:**
- Fundraising campaigns: "Last year, 450 acts of educational compassion accumulated 18,000 Blessings, supporting 120 at-risk students"
- Accreditation reports: "Despite budget constraints, mission integrity scores averaged 0.81, demonstrating organizational resilience"

---

## Dashboard & Reporting

### Real-Time BR Dashboard (Neurosymbolic Tier)
Mythara provides a web-based dashboard showing:
- **Cumulative BR over time** (line chart)
- **BR by event type** (bar chart: treatments, counseling, donations, etc.)
- **Integrity score trends** (are staff maintaining mission fidelity under stress?)
- **Paradox severity heatmap** (which departments face highest constraint?)

**Access:**
```
https://dashboard.mythara.ai/org/[YOUR_ORG_ID]
Login: API key or SSO integration
```

### Quarterly Impact Reports (Mythic-Resonant Tier)
Mythara generates board-ready PDF reports including:
- Executive summary of BR accumulation
- Narrative case studies (anonymized) of high-integrity events
- Comparative analysis (how does your integrity compare to sector benchmarks?)
- Donor-facing storytelling ("Your generosity this quarter enabled...")

## Calibration & Tuning

### Initial Setup Call (Included in All Tiers)
During onboarding, Mythara works with your team to:
1. **Map sacred acts** to BR-trackable events
2. **Calibrate BR weights** (is a counseling session worth +10 or +15?)
3. **Set paradox thresholds** (when does constraint become collapse?)
4. **Define integrity baselines** (what's "good enough" under duress?)

### Quarterly Recalibration (Neurosymbolic & Mythic-Resonant Tiers)
As your mission evolves, Mythara adjusts:
- BR scoring formulas
- Paradox severity mappings
- Integrity thresholds
- Narrative templates for donor communications

---

## Security & Compliance

### Data Sovereignty
- **Where is data stored?** US-based cloud infrastructure (AWS or Azure, client choice)
- **Who owns the data?** Your organization retains full ownership; Mythara is data processor only
- **Can we export data?** Yes, full CSV/JSON export via API at any time

### Audit Trails
Every BR transaction generates:
- SHA-256 integrity hash
- Timestamp (UTC)
- Event metadata (anonymized)
- API caller identity (API key or SSO user)

### Compliance Certifications
- **HIPAA**: Mythara is HIPAA-compliant (Business Associate Agreement available)
- **GDPR**: EU data handling protocols for international deployments
- **SOC 2**: Audit in progress (expected Q2 2026)

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: BR not incrementing after API call  
**Solution**: Check API response for `"error"` field; common causes:
- Invalid API key
- `soul_state` out of bounds [0,1]
- `paradox_severity` out of bounds [0,1]

**Issue**: Integrity scores seem too low  
**Solution**: Calibration may be needed; contact Mythara support to adjust alignment/tolerance weights

**Issue**: Dashboard not loading  
**Solution**: Verify API key has `dashboard:read` scope; check browser console for CORS errors

### Contact Support
- **Email**: support@mythara.ai
- **Slack**: [Client workspace invite sent post-onboarding]
- **Phone**: +1 (XXX) XXX-XXXX [for Mythic-Resonant tier clients]
