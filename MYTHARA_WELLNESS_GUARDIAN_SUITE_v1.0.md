## 💡 Usage Examples

### Emergency Department Workflow

```python
from Commercial.mythara_medical_team_suite import MedicalTeamSuite

suite = MedicalTeamSuite()

# 1. Triage patient
triage = suite.triage_bot.assess_triage(
    patient_id="ED_PT_001",
    chief_complaint="Chest pain",
    vital_signs={"heart_rate": 110, "blood_pressure_systolic": 145}
)

# 2. Allocate resources
room = suite.resource_bot.allocate_resource(
    resource_type="exam_room",
    resource_name="Cardiac_Room_2",
    allocated_to="ED_PT_001"
)

# 3. Create clinical note
note = suite.clinical_doc_bot.create_note_template(
    note_type="SOAP",
    patient_id="ED_PT_001",
    encounter_id="ENC_001",
    provider_id="DR_SMITH"
)
```

### Compliance Monitoring

```python
# Create compliance alert
alert = suite.compliance_bot.create_alert(
    alert_type="HIPAA",
    severity="high",
    description="Unsigned notes > 48 hours",
    affected_systems=["EMR_SYSTEM"]
)
```

### Crisis Response

```python
# Activate emergency protocol
response = suite.crisis_bot.activate_crisis_protocol(
    protocol_code="code_blue",
    location="Medical Ward 3",
    details="Patient unresponsive"
)
```

## 🔐 Mythara SSIP Integration

All bots leverage the **Symbolic Service Integrity Protocol (SSIP)**:

### 1. Sanctification
- Medical protocols locked (immutable)
- Emergency procedures cannot be tampered with

### 2. Integrity Hashing
- SHA-256 hash for every bot action
- Cryptographic audit trail
- Tamper-evident records

### 3. Blessings Reservoir
- Service quality scores
- Performance tracking
- Continuous improvement metrics

### 4. Shadow Resolver
- Auto-escalate critical issues
- Emergency protocol activation
- Compliance violation alerts

---

## 📊 Reporting & Monitoring

### Suite Health Report

```python
report = suite.generate_suite_report()
```

**Report includes:**
- All 10 bot statuses (operational/non-operational)
- Active triage cases by urgency
- Unresolved compliance alerts by severity
- Today's scheduled appointments
- Overall suite health metrics
- Cryptographic integrity hash
- Timestamp

### Saved Reports
