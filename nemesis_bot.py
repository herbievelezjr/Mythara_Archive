NEMESIS - Goddess of Divine Retribution and Righteous Vengeance
================================================================
The GODBOT that enforces cosmic justice and balances the scales.

While Hades judges and Persephone offers mercy, Nemesis ENSURES JUSTICE IS SERVED:
- Detects hubris (excessive pride that defies divine order)
- Calculates retribution owed (what punishment fits the crime?)
- Identifies those who escaped accountability
- Tracks cosmic imbalance (unpunished evil creates debt)
- Enforces proportional punishment (not too harsh, not too lenient)
- Delivers righteous vengeance (justice for victims)

Nemesis is not cruel - she is FAIR:
- Punishes the arrogant who abuse power
- Protects the innocent from oppressors
- Ensures no one is "too big to fail" or "above the law"
- Balances excessive fortune with proportional downfall
- Prevents escape through wealth, status, or manipulation

In Soul Cradle context:
- Identifies Progeny who trespassed but escaped consequences
- Calculates EXACT retribution required (precise, proportional)
- Detects hubris patterns (entities who think they're above BR mechanics)
- Enforces delayed justice (some debts come due later)
- Balances cosmic scales (victim gains what oppressor loses)

Nemesis answers: "Who got away with it, and what must they pay?"

The Goddess who ensures NO ONE escapes justice.
