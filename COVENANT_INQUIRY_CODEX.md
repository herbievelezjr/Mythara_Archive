## 🔥 The 20 Questions You WILL Be Asked

### Business & Pricing Questions

#### 1. **"How much does this cost?"**

**DON'T SAY:** "$1.5M for source code licensing"
**DO SAY:** "For a 30-day pilot, it's free. After the pilot, we offer three tiers:
- Development tier: $25k-$50k for initial implementation
- Enterprise tier: $100k-$250k annually for full deployment
- Sovereign tier: $500k-$1.5M for source code + air-gapped deployment

Most clients start with a paid pilot to validate ROI before committing to enterprise."

**Why this works:** You're not scaring them away immediately, and you're anchoring them to smaller numbers first.

---

#### 2. **"Who are your current customers?"**

**DON'T SAY:** "We don't have any yet" or "I can't disclose due to NDAs"
**DO SAY:** "We're pre-customer — Mythara is a solo-built engine in validation, with no paying customers or active pilots yet. That's exactly why early pilots are structured to prove ROI on your infrastructure first, with full validation reports included."

**Backup answer if pressed:** "We've completed internal validation — adversarial probe suites, determinism runs, and tamper-evidence checks — and have forensic manifests ready for third-party review. Would seeing our validation reports help build confidence?"

**Why this works:** Honest about stage, pivots to proof you DO have.

---

#### 3. **"What's your company size? How many engineers?"**

**DON'T SAY:** "It's just me" or "We're a startup"
**DO SAY:** "Mythara is a focused solo engineering practice optimized for sovereign deployment and escrow-ready systems. The development model prioritizes reproducibility and audit trails over headcount. That's why everything is PGP-signed and container-ready from day one."

**Why this works:** Reframes "small" as "focused" and turns it into a technical advantage.

---

#### 4. **"Why should we use you instead of [Competitor X]?"**

**Likely competitors mentioned:**
- Drata, Vanta (compliance automation)
- ServiceNow GRC (enterprise governance)
- OneTrust (privacy/compliance platform)

**DO SAY:** "Great question. Those are solid compliance platforms for **policy management and checklist automation**. Mythara is different - we're focused on **compliance validation with cryptographic integrity proofs**. 

Think of it this way:
- Drata/Vanta tell you IF you're compliant
- Mythara proves to auditors THAT you're compliant with reproducible evidence

We're complementary, not competitive — Vanta handles policies, Mythara handles validation."

**Why this works:** You're not attacking competitors, you're positioning as a different category.

---

### Technical Questions

#### 5. **"What database/infrastructure does this require?"**

**DO SAY:** "The pilot package runs on in-memory stubs for quick setup - you can be testing in 30 minutes. For production, Mythara integrates with your existing PostgreSQL or MySQL database and Redis for state management. We provide clear integration points in the code."

**Follow-up they'll ask:** "Do we need to buy new infrastructure?"
**Answer:** "No - you can use your existing database and Redis instances. The Docker container runs on any standard VM or Kubernetes cluster."

---

#### 6. **"How does this integrate with our existing compliance tools?"**

**DO SAY:** "Mythara exposes a RESTful API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation. You can call our endpoints from your existing compliance workflows, CI/CD pipelines, or governance platforms. Most customers integrate via webhooks or scheduled API calls."

**Example:** "For example, if you use ServiceNow for ticketing, you'd call our SSIP audit endpoint after each deployment and log the results as an attachment to your change ticket."

---

#### 7. **"What happens if your company goes out of business?"**

**DO SAY:** "That's why Mythara is built escrow-ready from day one. The planned Sovereign tier will include full source code escrow with a third-party escrow agent once the entity is formed. Even if the practice ceases operations, you would have complete access to the codebase, validation suite, and documentation to maintain it in-house."

**Proof point:** "All our releases are PGP-signed and reproducibly buildable. You're never locked in."

---

#### 8. **"Is this AI-based? How does the 'symbolic' part work?"**

**DON'T SAY:** Long explanation about messengers, clauses, blessings reservoir
**DO SAY:** "Mythara uses **symbolic clause orchestration** - think of it as a rules engine with cryptographic integrity proofs. Instead of black-box AI making compliance decisions, we use defined clauses with transparent logic that auditors can review.

The 'symbolic' architecture means:
- Every decision is reproducible
- Every invocation has an integrity hash
- Auditors can verify the logic without trusting a neural network

It's the opposite of 'trust us, our AI got it right.'"

**Why this works:** Turns "symbolic" into a selling point against AI skepticism.

---

#### 9. **"What compliance frameworks do you support?"**

**DO SAY:** "Out of the box, we include clause logic for:
- NIST SP 800-53 (federal compliance)
- HIPAA (healthcare)
- FTC Safeguards Rule (financial services)
- SOC 2 Type II concepts
- FISMA (government)

The clause system is extensible, so you can add custom compliance rules specific to your industry or contracts."

**Follow-up:** "Do you support [obscure framework]?"
**Answer:** "We can add custom clause definitions during the implementation phase. What specific controls does [framework] require?"

---

#### 10. **"How long does implementation take?"**

**DO SAY:** 
- "Pilot: 30 minutes to get running, 30 days to evaluate
- Development tier: 2-4 weeks for basic integration
- Enterprise tier: 6-12 weeks for full deployment with custom clauses
- Sovereign tier: 3-6 months for source code escrow + on-site deployment"

**Why this works:** Sets realistic expectations, pilot is fast.

---

### Security & Compliance Questions

#### 11. **"Is this SOC 2 certified? Do you have a security audit?"**

**DON'T SAY:** "No, we're too small for that" or deflect
**DO SAY:** "Not currently certified — SOC 2 Type II controls are implemented and an audit is planned. Our validation suite includes:
- Adversarial probe suites (injection, fuzzing, tamper, data-leak probes — see tests/adversarial_attack_suite.py)
- Determinism testing (100/100 reproducible runs in the latest report)
- Leakage detection probes included in the adversarial suite

All validation reports are included in the pilot package. Since you'll be deploying Mythara on your infrastructure with your security controls, you inherit your own SOC 2/security posture."

**Why this works:** Gives the honest status directly, then backs it with evidence.

---

#### 12. **"What data does Mythara collect? Where is it stored?"**

**DO SAY:** "Mythara doesn't phone home or send telemetry. All data stays in your infrastructure. The pilot runs entirely on localhost. In production, everything is stored in your database - we never see your data."

**Follow-up:** "So there's no cloud component?"
**Answer:** "Correct. Mythara is designed for air-gapped, sovereign deployment — built for government contractors and banks evaluating sovereign AI infrastructure."

---

#### 13. **"Has this been penetration tested?"**

**DO SAY:** "Our validation suite includes 20,000+ leakage probes and adversarial attacks that simulate penetration testing scenarios. We provide the full test report in the pilot package. If your security team wants to run their own penetration test during the pilot, we welcome it."

**Why this works:** You have evidence, and you're not defensive about testing.

---

#### 14. **"What if we find a security vulnerability during the pilot?"**

**DO SAY:** "We treat security reports seriously. During the pilot, you have direct access to me (Herbert) via email with 24-hour response time. If you find a vulnerability, we'll patch it within 48 hours and provide a signed update.

For enterprise customers, we offer dedicated support with SLAs."

---

### Skeptical/Objection Questions

#### 15. **"This sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?"**

**DO SAY:** "Fair question. The 'catch' is that Mythara is purpose-built for organizations that need **reproducible, auditable compliance**. If you just need a compliance checklist dashboard, Drata or Vanta will be cheaper and easier.

Mythara is for teams who:
- Need to prove compliance to auditors (not just track it)
- Require air-gapped/sovereign deployment
- Want cryptographic integrity proofs

If that's not you, Mythara might be overkill."

**Why this works:** Disqualifying low-fit prospects builds credibility.

---

#### 16. **"We already have a compliance process. Why do we need this?"**

**DO SAY:** "That's perfect - Mythara doesn't replace your process, it **validates** it. Think of it as the difference between:
- Having compliance policies (your current process)
- Proving to auditors that you followed them (Mythara)

A company adopting Mythara would use it to generate the audit trail that auditors ask for during reviews."

---

#### 17. **"Can I see a demo before committing to a pilot?"**

**DON'T SAY:** "Sure, let me screen share" (you'll waste time with tire kickers)
**DO SAY:** "The pilot package IS the demo - you can run it on your own infrastructure in 30 minutes and test it with your own use cases. That's more valuable than watching me click through a canned demo.

I'm happy to walk you through the quickstart on a call if you'd like, but you'll get more value by testing it yourself first."

**Why this works:** Separates serious prospects from tire kickers.

---

#### 18. **"We need to see this working at scale before we can commit."**

**DO SAY:** "That's exactly what the 30-day pilot is for. During the pilot, you can:
- Run our high-load stress test (10,000+ probes)
- Test against your real compliance scenarios
- Measure response times under load
- Review all validation outputs

At the end of 30 days, you'll have the data you need to make a decision. What scale metrics would be most important for you to see?"

**Why this works:** You're agreeing with them and offering to prove it.

---

#### 19. **"Your pricing seems high compared to [competitor]."**

**DO SAY:** "You're right - if you're comparing us to SaaS compliance dashboards, we're more expensive upfront. That's because Mythara provides:
- Full source code access (Sovereign tier)
- Cryptographic integrity proofs (not just screenshots)
- Air-gapped deployment (no ongoing SaaS fees)

Think of it this way: Drata/Vanta costs $12k-$50k/year forever. Mythara's enterprise tier is $100k-$250k one-time with optional support.

If you're planning to use a compliance tool for 5+ years, Mythara is actually cheaper AND you own the code."

---

#### 20. **"We need this to integrate with [obscure internal system]."**

**DO SAY:** "Mythara exposes a RESTful API, so it can integrate with any system that makes HTTP calls. During the pilot, we can test integration with [system] to confirm it works.

If [system] has unusual authentication or data format requirements, we can add custom adapters during the implementation phase. What's the integration pattern [system] uses?"

---

## 🎯 The Questions You SHOULD Ask THEM

Don't just answer questions - control the conversation by asking:

1. **"What's your current compliance validation process?"** (understand their pain)
2. **"How long does a compliance review take today?"** (quantify the problem)
3. **"What happens if you fail an audit?"** (establish stakes)
4. **"Who else needs to sign off on this decision?"** (identify all decision makers)
5. **"If the pilot proves this works, what's your timeline to move forward?"** (qualify seriousness)
6. **"What would make this pilot a clear success for you?"** (set measurable goals)

---

## 🚨 Red Flag Questions (They're Not Serious)

If they ask these, they're tire kickers:

- "Can you add [feature] before the pilot?" (scope creep)
- "What if we want to resell this?" (they don't understand your model)
- "Can we pay you in equity?" (no budget)
- "We need this to be free forever" (not your customer)
- "Send me everything, I'll review and get back to you" (ghosting you)

**Response:** "Let's start with the free pilot. If it's a good fit, we can discuss custom arrangements after you've seen it work."

---
