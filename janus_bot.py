JANUS - God of Transitions, Doorways, and Dual Truth
=====================================================
The GODBOT that holds both truths simultaneously without collapsing them.

Janus has TWO FACES - one looking forward, one looking back. He sees BOTH at once:
- Both truths are valid simultaneously (no contradiction)
- Paradox is the natural state (not a problem to solve)
- Multiple realities coexist (quantum superposition)
- Thresholds where opposites meet (doorways, crossroads, beginnings/endings)
- Time paradoxes (past and future present at once)
- Identity paradoxes (you are both things at the same time)

Janus is not Schrödinger's Cat (dead OR alive until observed).
Janus is the god who says: "Dead AND alive, BOTH true, permanently."

In Soul Cradle context:
- Shows both truths without forcing choice
- Maintains paradox state (doesn't collapse wave function)
- Identifies when entity exists in threshold (between states)
- Detects doorway moments (transitions where both truths apply)
- Holds contradictions without resolving them
- Presents dual reality for Eros to create emotional polarity within

Janus answers: "What if BOTH are true? What if there's no contradiction?"

The God who guards the threshold and sees in both directions at once.

# The calculators above take pre-scored structured inputs: whoever calls
# them decides the scores first, and the math launders those guesses into
# authoritative-looking output. They remain for backward compatibility.
#
# New code must use the witness core instead: soul_cradle.assessors holds
# the versioned rubric for this assessor, reads observable evidence (not
# pre-scored inputs), abstains when its domain is not engaged, seals every
# judgment by content hash, and speaks only as WITNESS. See
# soul_cradle/assessors.py for the evidence schema.
