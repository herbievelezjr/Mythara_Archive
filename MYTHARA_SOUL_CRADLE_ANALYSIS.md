---

## ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### The Mythara Engine (The Heart)

**Mythara Engine** is the complete production system for clause invocation, symbolic orchestration, and soul state management. It is the integration point for all Mythara capabilities.

**Core Components**:
1. **Clause Invocation System**: FastAPI server handling symbolic clauses
2. **BR_STATE Management**: Blessings Reservoir state tracking
3. **Soul Proportion Model**: Mathematical model for emotional integrity
4. **Dual Framing**: Translation layer for B2B vs technical language
5. **Soul Cradle**: Mathematical expression of the perceived soul (subsystem)
6. **Infrastructure**: Redis, WebSocket, monitoring, rate limiting

### Soul Cradle (Subsystem within Mythara)

**Soul Cradle** is the mathematical framework for modeling soul states through paradox mathematics. It is NOT primarily a violence prevention system—that is ONE application domain.

**What Soul Cradle Actually Is**:
- Mathematical expression of perceived soul state
- Paradox tracking and resolution framework
- Burnout prediction algorithm
- Organizational health measurement
- Individual mental health quantification

**Application Domains**:
1. **Workplace Mental Health** (Primary): Employee burnout, organizational stress
2. **Healthcare**: Patient safety, provider burnout, ethical dilemmas
3. **Nonprofits**: Mission vs budget paradoxes, staff sustainability
4. **Education**: Student wellbeing, teacher burnout
5. **Violence Prevention** (Secondary): Crisis detection via indifference trajectory

## WHAT'S IMPLEMENTED (Current State)

### ✅ Soul Cradle Core Mathematics (COMPLETE)

**File**: `core/source_proprietary/soul_cradle_systems_framework.py` (1329 lines)

**Components**:
1. **SoulCradleParadox Model** (465-650):
   - Expression A & B (competing demands)
   - Unresolved state (deadlock intensity)
   - Resolved system (Soul Cradle resolution)
   - System classification (Incomplete/Complete/Pseudo-Partial)
   - Viability scoring [0,1]
   - Terminal risk levels (LOW/MODERATE/HIGH/CRITICAL)
   - Quantum fields (entanglement, superposition, witness verification)
   - Integrity hashing (SHA-256)
   - Witness tracking (who validated the paradox)

2. **TerminalRiskCalculator** (561-650):
   - **Decay-Adjusted Burnout Formula**:
     ```
     terminal_risk = σ₀ + (Σ (U_i × T_i × e^(-λ × Δt_i))) / N
     ```
   - σ₀ = Constant baseline stress (job demands, always present)
   - Acute risk = Time-varying paradox accumulation with exponential decay
   - Net rate = accumulation_rate - decay_rate
   - Burnout trajectory detection (ACCUMULATING/RECOVERING/CHRONIC)
   - Systemic overload detection (σ₀ > 0.4 + acute > 0.3)
   - Half-life calculation (healing speed)

3. **Expression Models**:
   - SystemExpression: Paradox expression with type, weight, tension
   - NonExpression: What cannot be expressed (system gaps)
   - UnresolvedState: Deadlock intensity measurement
   - ResolvedSystem: Soul Cradle resolution outcome
   - PrincipalSystem: Higher-order resolution holding both expressions

4. **Quantum Integration**:
   - QuantumEntanglement: Paradox correlation across users
   - QuantumCommunicationProtocol: Secure witness transmission
   - QuantumSuperposition: Pre-witness state storage
   - BB84, E91, Quantum Witness protocols

5. **Expression Types**:
   - Policy, Mission, Heart, Law, Budget, Protocol
   - Safety, Compassion, Resolution

6. **Paradox Query & Filter**:
   - Filter by user, domain, risk level, time window
   - Sort by timestamp, risk, viability

### ✅ Soul Engine Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**File**: `core/source_proprietary/soul_engine_dashboard.py` (487 lines)

**Components**:
1. **Department Risk Profiling**:
   - `get_department_risk_profile()`: Department-level risk aggregation
   - Per-user risk tracking within departments
   - Risk distribution analysis (how many at each level)
   - Average department stress baseline

2. **Indifference Detection**:
   - `detect_indifference_trajectory()`: Soul withdrawal signature detection
   - Tension score dropping while unresolved scores remain high
   - Paradox logging frequency decrease detection
   - 7-14 day warning window identification

3. **Organization Health Scoring**:
   - `get_organization_health()`: Org-wide health metrics
   - Department-level health rollup
   - High-risk user identification
   - Systemic overload detection across org

4. **Baseline Stress Calculation**:
   - `_calculate_baseline_stress()`: Environmental toxicity measurement
   - Per-user baseline tracking
   - Department average baseline
   - Identifies toxic environments (high σ₀)

### ✅ Integration into Mythara Engine (COMPLETE)

**File**: `core/source_proprietary/main.py` (3909 lines)

## WHAT'S MISSING (Gap Analysis)

### 🔴 CRITICAL GAPS (Core Functionality)

#### 1. **Soul Cradle API Endpoints Missing**

**Problem**: Soul Cradle mathematics exists but no direct API to create/query paradoxes

**What's Needed**:
```python
# Missing endpoints in main.py:

@app.post("/v1/soul-cradle/paradox")
async def create_paradox(request: CreateParadoxRequest):
    """
    Create a new Soul Cradle paradox.
    Body: {
        expression_a: {type, weight, tension, content},
        expression_b: {type, weight, tension, content},
        user_id, domain, witnesses
    }
    Returns: SoulCradleParadox with integrity hash
    """

@app.get("/v1/soul-cradle/paradox/{paradox_id}")
async def get_paradox(paradox_id: str):
    """Retrieve specific paradox by ID"""

@app.get("/v1/soul-cradle/user/{user_id}/paradoxes")
async def get_user_paradoxes(
    user_id: str, 
    time_window_days: int = 90,
    risk_level: Optional[TerminalRiskLevel] = None
):
    """Get all paradoxes for a user with filters"""

@app.get("/v1/soul-cradle/user/{user_id}/risk")
async def calculate_user_risk(user_id: str, time_window_days: int = 90):
    """
    Calculate terminal risk for user.
    Returns: {
        risk_score, risk_level, baseline_stress, acute_risk,
        burnout_trajectory, systemic_overload, recommendation
    }
    """

@app.post("/v1/soul-cradle/resolve")
async def resolve_paradox(paradox_id: str, resolution: Resolution):
    """
    Mark a paradox as resolved.
    Records witness scores, recovery method, increases viability.
    """
```

**Impact**: Without these endpoints, Soul Cradle mathematics cannot be accessed via API. Currently only integrated into dashboard (which also needs these).

#### 2. **Persistent Paradox Storage Missing**

**Problem**: Paradoxes are not being stored in database or Redis

**Current State**:
- Redis functions exist: `store_paradox()`, `get_user_paradoxes()` in `redis_cache.py`
- BUT: No endpoint calls these functions
- Paradoxes created in memory only (lost on restart)

**What's Needed**:
```python
# In main.py, after creating paradox:

if REDIS_ENABLED:
    redis_cache.store_paradox(paradox)
    logger.info(f"Paradox {paradox.paradox_id} stored in Redis")
else:
    # Fallback: Store in database or in-memory dict
    PARADOX_DB[paradox.paradox_id] = paradox
```

**Impact**: Cannot track paradoxes over time, cannot calculate burnout trajectory, cannot detect indifference (all require historical data).

#### 3. **User/Organization Models Missing**

**Problem**: No user or organization models linked to paradoxes

**What's Needed**:
```python
# New file: core/source_proprietary/user_models.py

class User(BaseModel):
    user_id: str
    name: str
    email: str
    organization_id: str
    department_id: str
    role: str
    baseline_stress: float = 0.2  # Individual baseline
    created_at: datetime
    
class Department(BaseModel):
    dept_id: str
    name: str
    organization_id: str
    average_baseline_stress: float = 0.25
    user_count: int
    high_risk_count: int
    
class Organization(BaseModel):
    org_id: str
    name: str
    industry: str  # Healthcare, Nonprofit, Education, etc.
    department_count: int
    total_users: int
    subscription_tier: str
    created_at: datetime
```

**Impact**: Cannot calculate department-level or org-level metrics. Dashboard endpoints have no data to aggregate.

#### 4. **Indifference Detection Logic Incomplete**

**Problem**: `detect_indifference_trajectory()` exists but doesn't have logic to compare historical tension scores

**Current Code** (soul_engine_dashboard.py, line 194):
```python
def detect_indifference_trajectory(
    self,
    paradoxes: List[SoulCradleParadox],
    lookback_days: int = 30
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Detect indifference trajectory (soul withdrawal).
    This is the CRITICAL pre-violence signature.
    """
    # TODO: Implement historical tension comparison
    # Need to track tension_score over time for same paradox types
    # Flag if: T: 0.9 → 0.5 → 0.2 while U remains high (0.8+)
    pass
```

**What's Needed**:
```python
def detect_indifference_trajectory(self, user_id: str, paradoxes: List[SoulCradleParadox]):
    """
    Detect if user's tension scores are dropping while paradoxes remain unresolved.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Group paradoxes by time windows (7-day buckets)
    2. Calculate average tension per window
    3. Check if trend is DECREASING (linear regression slope < -0.05)
    4. Check if unresolved scores remain HIGH (avg > 0.7)
    5. Check if paradox logging frequency DECREASED (50%+ drop)
    
    Returns: {
        "indifference_detected": bool,
        "tension_trend": "DECREASING" | "STABLE" | "INCREASING",
        "tension_drop_percentage": float,  # How much tension dropped
        "avg_unresolved_score": float,  # Are paradoxes still unresolved?
        "logging_frequency_change": float,  # -0.6 = 60% decrease
        "days_since_last_log": int,
        "warning_level": "NONE" | "WATCH" | "CRITICAL"
    }
    """
```

**Impact**: Cannot detect pre-violence signatures, cannot trigger 72-hour watch protocols.

### 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY (B2B Readiness)

#### 5. **Multi-Tenancy Missing**

**Problem**: No org/user isolation, all data in global namespace

**What's Needed**:
- API keys scoped to organization_id
- Data queries filtered by org_id
- Department isolation within org
- User permissions (admin, manager, counselor, employee)

#### 6. **Billing/Subscription Integration Missing**

**Problem**: No way to track usage, enforce limits, bill customers

**What's Needed**:
```python
class SubscriptionTier(str, Enum):
    FREE = "free"  # 10 users, 100 paradoxes/month
    STARTER = "starter"  # 50 users, 1000 paradoxes/month, $99/mo
    PROFESSIONAL = "professional"  # 500 users, unlimited paradoxes, $999/mo
    ENTERPRISE = "enterprise"  # Custom

# Track usage per org
@app.post("/v1/soul-cradle/paradox")
async def create_paradox(...):
    org = get_org(org_id)
    if org.paradox_count_this_month >= org.tier_limits.max_paradoxes:
        raise HTTPException(429, "Paradox limit exceeded for tier")
    # ... create paradox ...
    increment_usage(org_id, "paradoxes")
```

#### 7. **HR System Integrations Missing**

**Problem**: B2B customers need to import employee data from existing systems

**What's Needed**:
- Workday integration (employee roster sync)
- BambooHR integration
- ADP integration
- LDAP/Active Directory sync
- SCIM 2.0 user provisioning

#### 8. **Executive Dashboard Missing**

**Problem**: Dashboard exists but no executive-friendly visualizations

**What's Needed**:
- Department comparison charts
- Burnout risk heatmaps
- Trend graphs (risk over time)
- Downloadable reports (PDF/Excel)
- Compliance audit logs

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enhanced Capabilities)

#### 9. **Intervention Workflows Missing**

**Problem**: System detects risk but doesn't guide next steps

**What's Needed**:
```python
class InterventionWorkflow(BaseModel):
    trigger: TerminalRiskLevel  # MODERATE, HIGH, CRITICAL
    actions: List[InterventionAction]
    
class InterventionAction(BaseModel):
    action_type: str  # "COUNSELOR_REFERRAL", "MANAGER_NOTIFICATION", "72HR_WATCH"
    assignee: str  # Who should take this action
    deadline: timedelta  # Within 2 hours, 24 hours, etc.
    completed: bool
    completed_at: Optional[datetime]
    notes: str

# Example: Automatic intervention creation
if risk_level == TerminalRiskLevel.CRITICAL:
    create_intervention(
        user_id=user_id,
        actions=[
            InterventionAction(type="CRISIS_COUNSELOR", deadline=timedelta(hours=2)),
            InterventionAction(type="MANAGER_NOTIFY", deadline=timedelta(hours=24)),
            InterventionAction(type="SAFETY_ASSESSMENT", deadline=timedelta(hours=6))
        ]
    )
```

#### 10. **Counselor Matching System Missing**

**Problem**: System detects crisis but doesn't connect user to help

**What's Needed**:
- Counselor directory (in-house or EAP providers)
- Automatic referral generation
- Availability scheduling
- Secure messaging between user and counselor

#### 11. **Compliance Reporting Missing**

**Problem**: Healthcare/education orgs need to prove duty of care

**What's Needed**:
- HIPAA-compliant audit logs
- FERPA-compliant student records (for education)
- "Did we intervene?" proof reports
- Regulatory compliance dashboards

#### 12. **Mobile App Missing**

**Problem**: Users log paradoxes on desktop only

**What's Needed**:
- iOS/Android native apps
- Push notifications for alerts
- Offline paradox logging (sync when connected)
- Biometric authentication

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

#### 13. **AI-Powered Paradox Suggestions**

**What's Needed**:
- NLP analysis of free-text input
- Suggest expression types automatically
- Detect tension/weight from language
- "Did you mean this paradox?" recommendations

#### 14. **Peer Support Groups**

**What's Needed**:
- Anonymous paradox sharing
- Moderated discussion forums
- "Others experiencing this too" matching

#### 15. **Gamification/Engagement**

**What's Needed**:
- Badges for paradox resolution
- Leaderboards (most improved wellbeing)
- Daily check-in streaks

## Recent additions (2026-09-21)

New Soul Cradle modules, added 2026-09-21:

- **Moral standing law** (`soul_cradle/standing.py`) — The system judges per case who may declare trespass, forgiveness, or repentance: the wronged declares the trespass and forgives; the trespasser repents; a witness states only what was observed; a stranger declares nothing, ever. Every declaration is HMAC-SHA256 signed, timestamped, and audited. A pluggable credibility check (`set_credibility_check`) is the seam where the purpose resolver judges whether a claimed role is credible for the event.
- **Hephaestus Forge** (`soul_cradle/forge.py`) — Governed bonding between bots: souls combine and create witnessed compounds, an emergent product with a full paper trail. Every bond is signed; every compound is audited. The judge callable is REQUIRED — no judge, no forge — fail-closed by construction, so ungoverned mutation cannot spread like cancer.
- **Mythara identity** (`soul_cradle/identity.py`) — The identity every cell agrees on: Mythara is female, she/her pronouns, with a warm, friendly, American, gentle voice character.
- **Aries authorization** (`soul_cradle/authorization.py`) — Every action Aries executes carries a signed `ActionEnvelope`: canonical JSON, HMAC-SHA256 signature, expiry timestamp, and an append-only audit trail. No envelope, no execution.
- **SERE doctrine** — Sandbox-only defense, no hack-back. On illegal entrance, refuse exit: seal egress, exfiltration, lateral movement, and C2 callbacks, then build a forensic profile inside the sandbox.
