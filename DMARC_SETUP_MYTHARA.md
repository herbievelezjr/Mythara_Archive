**Copyright © 2025 Herbert Velez Jr. All rights reserved.**

---

## Current Status (as of Nov 18, 2025)

✅ **Domain**: mythara.io (active on Hostinger)
✅ **MX Records**: mx1.hostinger.com, mx2.hostinger.com
✅ **SPF**: `v=spf1 include:_spf.mail.hostinger.com ~all`
⚠️ **DMARC**: `v=DMARC1; p=none` (monitoring only, needs improvement)
❌ **SendGrid**: Not included in SPF yet

---

## Step 1: Update SPF Record (Add SendGrid)

**Current SPF:**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.mail.hostinger.com ~all
```

**New SPF (include SendGrid):**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.mail.hostinger.com include:sendgrid.net ~all
```

**Where to update:**
1. Log into Hostinger
2. Go to: Domains → mythara.io → DNS Zone Editor
3. Find the TXT record with SPF (starts with `v=spf1`)
4. Edit it to add `include:sendgrid.net`
5. Save

---

## Step 2: Add SendGrid DKIM Records

**Get your DKIM keys from SendGrid:**
1. Log into SendGrid dashboard: https://app.sendgrid.com/
2. Go to: Settings → Sender Authentication → Authenticate Your Domain
3. Select "mythara.io" as your domain
4. SendGrid will give you 3 CNAME records like:

```
Host: s1._domainkey.mythara.io
Points to: s1.domainkey.u12345678.wl123.sendgrid.net

Host: s2._domainkey.mythara.io
Points to: s2.domainkey.u12345678.wl123.sendgrid.net

Host: em1234.mythara.io
Points to: u12345678.wl123.sendgrid.net
```

**Add these to Hostinger DNS:**
1. In Hostinger DNS Zone Editor
2. Click "Add Record"
3. Type: CNAME
4. Add all 3 records exactly as SendGrid provides
5. Save and wait 24-48 hours for propagation

---

## Step 3: Upgrade DMARC Policy (Full Compliance)

**Current DMARC:**
```
v=DMARC1; p=none
```

**Phase 1 - Monitoring (start here):**
```
v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@mythara.io; ruf=mailto:dmarc@mythara.io; pct=100; adkim=r; aspf=r; fo=1
```

**Phase 2 - Quarantine (after 2 weeks of clean reports):**
```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@mythara.io; ruf=mailto:dmarc@mythara.io; pct=10; adkim=r; aspf=r; fo=1
```

**Phase 3 - Reject (full protection):**
```
v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@mythara.io; ruf=mailto:dmarc@mythara.io; pct=100; adkim=s; aspf=s; fo=1
```

**What each tag means:**
- `p=none` = Monitor only (no blocking)
- `p=quarantine` = Send suspicious emails to spam
- `p=reject` = Block unauthorized emails completely
- `rua` = Aggregate reports sent here
- `ruf` = Forensic (detailed) reports sent here
- `pct` = Percentage of emails to apply policy to
- `adkim=r/s` = DKIM alignment (relaxed/strict)
- `aspf=r/s` = SPF alignment (relaxed/strict)
- `fo=1` = Generate failure report if either SPF or DKIM fails

**Where to update:**
1. In Hostinger DNS Zone Editor
2. Find the TXT record: `_dmarc.mythara.io`
3. Replace with Phase 1 policy above
4. Save

---

## Step 4: Set up DMARC Report Inbox

**Option A - Use existing email:**
Create `dmarc@mythara.io` in Hostinger email:
1. Log into Hostinger
2. Go to: Email → Add Email Account
3. Create: dmarc@mythara.io
4. Forward to: mythara@mythara.io or herbievelezjr@gmail.com

**Option B - Use free DMARC monitoring service:**
- **Valimail Monitor** (free): https://www.valimail.com/
- **Postmark DMARC Digests** (free): https://dmarc.postmarkapp.com/
- **DMARC Analyzer** (free tier): https://www.dmarcanalyzer.com/

These services will:
- Parse DMARC reports automatically
- Show you who's sending emails
- Alert on unauthorized senders
- Give compliance score

---

## Step 5: Verify Everything

**Test your setup:**

```powershell
# Check SPF
nslookup -type=TXT mythara.io

# Check DMARC
nslookup -type=TXT _dmarc.mythara.io

# Check DKIM (after SendGrid setup)
nslookup -type=CNAME s1._domainkey.mythara.io
nslookup -type=CNAME s2._domainkey.mythara.io
```

**Online tools:**
- MXToolbox: https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=dmarc%3amythara.io
- DMARC Check: https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-inspector/
- Mail Tester: https://www.mail-tester.com/ (send test email)

## Timeline for Full Compliance

### Week 1: Setup
- ✅ Update SPF to include SendGrid
- ✅ Add SendGrid DKIM records
- ✅ Set DMARC to `p=none` with reporting
- ✅ Set up dmarc@mythara.io inbox

### Week 2-3: Monitor
- Check DMARC reports daily
- Verify all legitimate emails pass SPF+DKIM
- Identify any unauthorized senders

### Week 4: Quarantine
- Change DMARC policy to `p=quarantine; pct=10`
- Monitor for false positives
- Gradually increase pct to 100

### Week 6-8: Reject (Full Compliance)
- Change DMARC policy to `p=reject`
- Set alignment to strict (`adkim=s; aspf=s`)
- Monitor reports for 2 weeks
- **You're now DMARC compliant!**
