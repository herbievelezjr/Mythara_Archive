## 🎯 Pilot Tier = Self-Hosted Only

**What You Get for $49:**
- ✅ Docker container with full Mythara Engine
- ✅ API documentation & SDK access
- ✅ License key for pilot evaluation
- ✅ Community support (GitHub issues)
- ✅ One pilot per business domain

**What You DON'T Get:**
- ❌ Hosted API service on Mythara's infrastructure
- ❌ 24/7 managed hosting
- ❌ SLA guarantees
- ❌ Priority support

**Why Self-Hosted?**
You deploy Mythara on YOUR infrastructure (Railway, AWS, Azure, etc.) and YOU pay the hosting costs. This keeps the pilot tier affordable at $49 while giving you full control over your deployment.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "License key invalid"
- Check your email for the correct license key
- Ensure no extra spaces or line breaks
- Contact support: Mythara.Engine@yahoo.com

### "Port already in use"
- Change PORT environment variable: `PORT=8001`
- Or stop conflicting service: `docker ps` → `docker stop <container>`

### "Database connection failed"
- Default uses in-memory storage (fine for pilot)
- For persistent storage, set DATABASE_URL
- Supported: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite

### "High hosting costs"
- Review your usage in platform dashboard
- Consider adding caching (Redis)
- Optimize API call frequency
- Contact sales for Enterprise tier (unlimited hosted)
