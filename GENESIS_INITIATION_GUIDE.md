# Mythara Engine Pilot - Distribution Guide
**Copyright © 2025 Herbert Velez Jr. All rights reserved.**

## Overview

After a client purchases pilot access via Stripe, you send them TWO things:
1. **Email with access credentials**
2. **Pilot package download link**

---

## Step 1: Generate Client API Key (After Payment)

> **⚠️ DISABLED — no payment path exists.** All Stripe webhooks (Test and Live) were deleted, so no webhook can confirm payment. The key-generation instructions below are historical; do not present this as a live flow.

~~After Stripe webhook confirms payment, generate a unique API key for the client:~~

```bash
# Generate a unique pilot API key
python3 -c "import secrets; print('sk_pilot_' + secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"

# Example output: <YOUR_PILOT_API_KEY>
```

**Store this** in a simple JSON file or spreadsheet:
```json
{
  "client_email": "john@company.com",
  "company_name": "ACME Corp",
  "api_key": "<YOUR_PILOT_API_KEY>",
  "purchase_date": "2025-11-11",
  "expiry_date": "2025-12-11",
  "stripe_session_id": "cs_test_abc123"
}
```

## Step 2: Send Welcome Email

**Subject:** Mythara Engine Pilot - Access Details

**Body:**

```

## Step 3: Create the Pilot Package (One-Time Setup)

Create a distribution package that clients download:
