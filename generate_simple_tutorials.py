Mythara holds the space when your mission conflicts with compliance. 

Say you're a hospital social worker. Policy says discharge this patient. 
Your heart says they'll be homeless. Both are true.

Soul Cradle documents that paradox. Measures the cost to your soul 
and the mission. Creates an immutable record.

We donate Soul Cradle to healthcare, banking, justice, nonprofits, 
civil service, education—the industries carrying impossible weight.

Try it: 49 dollars for 7 days. Full access. See if it fits your reality.

We generate a cryptographic hash. Timestamp it. Make it immutable.

Leadership sees the pattern across your org. They spot burnout 
before people break.

Audit-ready. Court-ready. Human-ready.

We donate Soul Cradle to the industries that need it most:
Healthcare, banking, justice, nonprofits, civil service, education.

It's included in every tier. No charge.

Because some things shouldn't have a price.
