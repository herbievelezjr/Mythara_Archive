## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Framework Validation
Validate data against multiple regulatory frameworks **simultaneously**:

```python
POST /v1/compliance/validate
{
  "data": {...},
  "frameworks": ["pci_dss", "sox", "hipaa", "nlra"]
}
```

Returns:
- ✅ Overall compliance status
- 📋 Violations by framework
- ⚠️ Risk assessment (NEGLIGIBLE → CRITICAL)
- 🔒 Tamper-evident audit log

### 2. Automated Violation Detection

Each framework implements **specific validation logic**:

**PCI DSS Example:**
```python
# Detects violations automatically
❌ "PCI DSS Violation: card_number must not be stored"
❌ "PCI DSS Violation: CVV must not be stored"
✅ "Card tokenization required"
✅ "Encryption in transit required"
```

**NLRA Example:**
```python
# Protects union rights
❌ "NLRA Violation: Disciplinary action after union activity requires business reason"
❌ "NLRA Violation: Surveillance of union organizing prohibited"
✅ "Cannot prohibit wage discussions"
```

### 3. Risk Assessment Algorithm

```
Violations   Risk Level
---------    -----------
0            NEGLIGIBLE
1-2          LOW
3-5          MEDIUM
6-10         HIGH
11+          CRITICAL
```

### 4. Executive Compliance Reporting

```
GET /v1/compliance/report
```

Returns:
- Total audits performed
- 45+ frameworks supported
- Recent audit history
- Compliance status by category

## 🔒 Security Features

### Tamper-Evident Audit Logs

Every validation generates cryptographically signed audit log:

```json
{
  "log_id": "COMP_AUDIT_20251119103000_a1b2c3d4",
  "framework": "pci_dss",
  "event_type": "multi_framework_validation",
  "user_id": "user_12345",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-19T10:30:00Z",
  "status": "COMPLIANT",
  "findings": "[]",
  "integrity_hash": "sha256:7f8e9d0c1b2a3f4e5d6c7b8a9f0e1d2c..."
}
```

### Integrity Hash Computation

```python
audit_data = {
    "log_id": "...",
    "timestamp": "...",
    "results": {...}
}
integrity_hash = hashlib.sha256(
    json.dumps(audit_data, sort_keys=True).encode()
).hexdigest()
```

Ensures:
- ✅ Audit logs cannot be tampered without detection
- ✅ Cryptographic proof of compliance status
- ✅ Forensic audit trail for regulatory review

## Recent additions (2026-09-21)

New Soul Cradle modules, added 2026-09-21:

- **Moral standing law** (`soul_cradle/standing.py`) — The system judges per case who may declare trespass, forgiveness, or repentance: the wronged declares the trespass and forgives; the trespasser repents; a witness states only what was observed; a stranger declares nothing, ever. Every declaration is HMAC-SHA256 signed, timestamped, and audited. A pluggable credibility check (`set_credibility_check`) is the seam where the purpose resolver judges whether a claimed role is credible for the event.
- **Hephaestus Forge** (`soul_cradle/forge.py`) — Governed bonding between bots: souls combine and create witnessed compounds, an emergent product with a full paper trail. Every bond is signed; every compound is audited. The judge callable is REQUIRED — no judge, no forge — fail-closed by construction, so ungoverned mutation cannot spread like cancer.
- **Mythara identity** (`soul_cradle/identity.py`) — The identity every cell agrees on: Mythara is female, she/her pronouns, with a warm, friendly, American, gentle voice character.
- **Aries authorization** (`soul_cradle/authorization.py`) — Every action Aries executes carries a signed `ActionEnvelope`: canonical JSON, HMAC-SHA256 signature, expiry timestamp, and an append-only audit trail. No envelope, no execution.
- **SERE doctrine** — Sandbox-only defense, no hack-back. On illegal entrance, refuse exit: seal egress, exfiltration, lateral movement, and C2 callbacks, then build a forensic profile inside the sandbox.
