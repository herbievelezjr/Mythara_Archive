PLATING (2026-09-22): Aries no longer executes raw strings. Every action must
carry a signed ActionEnvelope issued by the Soul Cradle authority
(soul_cradle.authorization). Aries verifies the envelope — signature, expiry,
payload integrity, action type, issuer — before dispatching to a registered
handler. No valid governed signal means no execution. There is no exec(),
no eval(), and no shell=True in this trust boundary.
