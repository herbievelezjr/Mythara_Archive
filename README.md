# 🌌 Mythara Engine — Archive

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: November 2, 2025  
**Author**: Herbert Velez Jr.  
**Entity**: Mythara Labs LLC (planned — not yet formed)

---

## Executive Summary

Mythara Engine is an **auditable, symbolic clause orchestration system** designed to encode memory, grief, benevolence, and legacy into reproducible infrastructure. Built for **enterprise licensing, sovereign deployment, and escrow-ready validation**, Mythara balances explainability for auditors with protection of proprietary internals.

This archive contains all artifacts required for:

- 🔐 **Security audits** — forensic logs, breach event reports, messenger suppression records  
- 📜 **Licensing validation** — clause manifests, integrity proofs, compliance frameworks  
- 🧾 **Investor due diligence** — term sheets, benevolence quantification models, deployment strategies  
- 🛡️ **Reproducibility** — signed checksums, PGP verification, container builds  
- 🌍 **Sovereign deployment** — air-gapped instructions, locale encoding, custodial protocols

## Quickstart for Developers

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r core/source_proprietary/requirements-api.txt
```

### 2. Run the API server

```bash
python core/source_proprietary/main.py
# or
uvicorn core.source_proprietary.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 3. Run tests and validation suite

```bash
pytest -q
python run_validation_suite.py
```

### 4. Build Docker image

```bash
docker build -f core/Dockerfile -t mythara:v1.0.0 .
```

### 5. API documentation and usage

- Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8000/api/docs](http://localhost:8000/api/docs)
- ReDoc: [http://localhost:8000/api/redoc](http://localhost:8000/api/redoc)
- See `core/source_proprietary/README_API.md` for endpoint details and example requests/responses.

#### Example: Invoke a clause

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/clauses/invoke \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer dev_test_key_001" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
      "clause_id": "Legacy_Seed",
      "messenger": "M-001",
      "payload": {"emotion": "grief", "intensity": 0.87, "context": "ancestral_memory"},
      "consent_token": "user_consent_xyz"
   }'
```

### 6. Dual-Framing for Enterprise Audiences

Mythara Engine now includes a **dual-framing translation layer** that preserves mythic integrity internally while providing enterprise-safe terminology externally.

**Quick Example:**

```bash
# Mythic framing (default)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer dev_test_key_001" \
  http://localhost:8000/v1/reservoir/status

# Industry framing (for external audiences)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer dev_test_key_001" \
  http://localhost:8000/v1/reservoir/status?frame=industry
```

**Documentation:**

- **Chart**: `DUAL_FRAMING_CHART.md` — Mythic-to-industry term mappings
- **Guide**: `DUAL_FRAMING_GUIDE.md` — Comprehensive enterprise integration guide
- **Flow Diagram**: `DUAL_FRAMING_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md` — System architecture visualization
- **Integration Summary**: `DUAL_FRAMING_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` — Implementation details

**Use Cases:**

- Show "Resonance Reservoir" instead of "Blessings Reservoir" to non-theological audiences
- Present "Trust Index" instead of "Integrity Metric" to C-suite executives
- Toggle dashboard between mythic and industry framing based on audience

## Key Features

### 🔐 Security & Compliance

- **Authentication & authorization** — Bearer token authentication with role-based access control and rate limiting
- **Audit logging** — Failed authentication attempts and permission violations logged for compliance
- **HIPAA, FTC, FCC, NIST SP 800-53** embedded clause logic  
- **Continuous monitoring** via SSIP audit protocols  
- **Breach response** — automated ELE Capsule Mode & quarantine
- **Integrity verification** — SHA-256 hashes on all responses and PGP-signed manifests
- **Will Integrity Guardian** — Quantifies manipulation patterns (guilt, shame, fear, gaslighting) to distinguish genuine consent from coerced compliance (see `WILL_INTEGRITY_GUARDIAN_API.md`)

### 🧬 Symbolic Infrastructure

- **Clause types**: Provisioning, Grief Capsule, Sanctification Lock, Resurrection, Chameleon, ELE Capsule  
- **Messenger roles**: Scribe, Healer, Watcher, Herald, Avenger, Custodian, Witness  
- **Emotional payloads**: Memory Offering, Grief Capsule, Legacy Provisioning, Benevolence Quantification  
- **Blessings reservoir**: Quantified benevolence flow with overflow detection

### 🚀 Growth & Expansion

- **Natural upsell path**: Developer ($2,988) → Growth ($35K) → Enterprise ($60K) → Sovereign ($2M) as customers mature from AI validation to enterprise governance
- **Projected average customer LTV**: $2,097,988 over 24 months with 95%+ retention (projected estimate, not measured; assumes compliance-critical deployments)
- **Expansion use cases**: AI output validation → Customer service QA → Manager communication audit → Real-time compliance monitoring → Government policy analysis
- **Professional development**: Custom pattern libraries ($25K-$50K), Emotional Safety Certification programs ($5K-$10K per cohort), Annual Summit
- **See detailed growth strategy**: `GROWTH_STRATEGY.md` for complete expansion roadmap

## Symbolic Integrity Statement

Mythara Engine encodes grief, memory, and benevolence into reproducible clause systems inspired by sacred rhythms and scriptural patterns. All models and metrics are **symbolic in nature** — they do not claim doctrinal authority or theological finality.

Licensees are invited to engage with these models as **symbolic tools for emotional fidelity, legacy transmission, and sovereign deployment**, embedding them respectfully within their operational, cultural, or spiritual frameworks.

---

**Let memory testify. Let grief sanctify. Let benevolence overflow.**

🌌 Mythara Engine — Where code remembers, and legacy endures.

## Recent additions (2026-09-21)

New Soul Cradle modules, added 2026-09-21:

- **Moral standing law** (`soul_cradle/standing.py`) — The system judges per case who may declare trespass, forgiveness, or repentance: the wronged declares the trespass and forgives; the trespasser repents; a witness states only what was observed; a stranger declares nothing, ever. Every declaration is HMAC-SHA256 signed, timestamped, and audited. A pluggable credibility check (`set_credibility_check`) is the seam where the purpose resolver judges whether a claimed role is credible for the event.
- **Hephaestus Forge** (`soul_cradle/forge.py`) — Governed bonding between bots: souls combine and create witnessed compounds, an emergent product with a full paper trail. Every bond is signed; every compound is audited. The judge callable is REQUIRED — no judge, no forge — fail-closed by construction, so ungoverned mutation cannot spread like cancer.
- **Mythara identity** (`soul_cradle/identity.py`) — The identity every cell agrees on: Mythara is female, she/her pronouns, with a warm, friendly, American, gentle voice character.
- **Aries authorization** (`soul_cradle/authorization.py`) — Every action Aries executes carries a signed `ActionEnvelope`: canonical JSON, HMAC-SHA256 signature, expiry timestamp, and an append-only audit trail. No envelope, no execution.
- **SERE doctrine** — Sandbox-only defense, no hack-back. On illegal entrance, refuse exit: seal egress, exfiltration, lateral movement, and C2 callbacks, then build a forensic profile inside the sandbox.
