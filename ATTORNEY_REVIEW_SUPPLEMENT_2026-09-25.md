# MYTHARA ARCHIVE — SUPPLEMENT FOR LEGAL REVIEW

**Copyright © 2026 Herbert Velez Jr. All rights reserved.**
**Preparation Date:** September 25, 2026
**Status:** DRAFT — prepared for legal counsel review, not legal advice
**Supplements:** `ATTORNEY_REVIEW_PACKAGE.md` (November 19, 2025)

---

## 1. PURPOSE

This supplement updates the November 2025 attorney review package with
everything that has changed since, states the current facts plainly, and
lists the questions the owner needs counsel to answer before any
commercial activity. It is written to be handed to a lawyer with the
November package.

---

## 2. CURRENT FACTS — STATED PLAINLY

These are facts, not aspirations. Every document in the repository is
required to agree with them (see `COMPLIANCE_STATUS.md`, the single
source of truth for claims).

- **No legal entity exists.** "Mythara Labs LLC" is planned, not formed.
  The "Soul Cradle Foundation" does not exist. All licenses are granted
  by Herbert Velez Jr. personally. An unsigned IP-assignment draft is
  held at `Legal/IP_Assignment_Agreement.md` for formation day.
- **No insurance exists.** No policy backs the software. No
  indemnification is offered. See `LICENSE.md`.
- **No certification has been achieved.** Not SOC 2, not ISO 27001, not
  HIPAA, not GDPR, not FedRAMP, not CMMC, not ITAR. Compliance products
  are sold — when sold — as **readiness assessments** (control mapping),
  never as certification. No independent audit has been completed.
- **No customers, pilots, revenue, or testimonials are claimed.**
  Fictional examples in sales material must be labeled fictional.
  (Prior fabricated claims — e.g. "3 banks piloting," a Western Union
  namedrop — were removed in September 2026.)
- **The repository is public** at
  `github.com/herbievelezjr/Mythara_Archive`. Public disclosure has
  already occurred; this affects patent options (see §5).
- **One exposed credential** (`sk_pilot_`-prefixed pilot key) was purged
  from the full git history on 2026-09-22 (102 commits rewritten, all
  branches force-updated). Its record in the project's pilot database
  has NOT yet been revoked — the key must be treated as live until the
  owner invalidates it there.

---

## 3. WHAT CHANGED SINCE NOVEMBER 2025

1. **Honest-tree pass (Sept 2026).** Fabricated social proof, fake
   urgency, fake certification language, and achieved-certification
   framing were removed across sales bots, outreach templates, and
   marketing docs. Remaining language is readiness/control-mapping only.
2. **Soul Cradle formalized.** The governance framework now has a
   mathematical statement (Integrity = Alignment × Tolerance; soul
   proportion S(t)) and is implemented in `soul_cradle/`.
3. **Assessor witnesses rebuilt (Sept 2026).** The 8 assessors
   (demeter, dionysus, eros, hades, hermes, janus, nemesis, persephone)
   are now evidence-fed witnesses with versioned rubrics, abstention
   rules, fail-closed behavior, content-hashed judgments, and preserved
   dissent. 134/134 focused tests green.
4. **Emotional chain built (Sept 2026).** `soul_cradle/emotional_chain.py`
   — tamper-evident hash-chained emotional records, each attested by the
   8 witnesses with sealed judgments chained alongside. The honest
   contract is stated in code and UI: the chain proves records are
   **unaltered, not true**. "Verified" means all engaged witnesses
   cleared; coercion markers are labeled heuristic; non-consensual
   third-party records are blocked. 13 tests green. A local demo journal
   app exists (`journal_app/`); it is localhost-only, no auth/TLS, not
   production.
5. **Terminology: "fluctlight" eliminated (Sept 2026).** The project
   previously used the term "fluctlight" for its artificial-soul
   concept. That term originates from the *Sword Art Online* fiction
   franchise. It has been removed from the entire repository (verified:
   zero occurrences) and replaced with **Goiz** — the Taíno word for the
   spirit of the living / breath of life — reflecting the owner's
   heritage. The Soul Cradle is now described as "the mechanism designed
   to eventually create the Goiz."
6. **Repo-wide legal scrub (in progress, Sept 25, 2026).** A systematic
   sweep for fabricated claims, entity/certification/insurance language,
   secrets, PII, and copyright issues is underway. Findings will be
   appended to this supplement as Appendix A when complete.

## 4. PRODUCT DIRECTION UNDER CONSIDERATION

The owner is evaluating a single narrow product: an **attestation API
for AI agents** ("notary for AI"). An agent submits an action; the API
returns a witnessed, hash-chained receipt proving what the agent did,
attested by the 8-witness panel, verifiable by any third party holding
the receipt. Pricing under consideration: per attested action,
self-serve (no enterprise contracts initially).

Regulatory touchpoints counsel should note:

- **EU AI Act, Article 12 (logging).** High-risk AI systems must keep
  automatic logs. The receipt is positioned as evidence-grade logging,
  not as a conformity assessment.
- **EU AI Act emotion-inference ban.** The Act bans emotion inference in
  workplaces/education. The product's framing is deliberate:
  **it attests self-reported records; it never infers emotions.**
  Counsel should confirm this framing holds under the Act.
- **Not a notary.** The product is *not* presented as online
  notarization (a licensed, state-regulated activity). It is
  notary-*grade* attestation for things notaries do not cover.
  Counsel should confirm the marketing line does not imply licensure.
- **Liability for attestation failure.** If a receipt is wrong or the
  chain is broken and a customer relies on it (e.g. for EU AI Act
  compliance), exposure questions arise. Current terms offer no
  indemnification; counsel should advise on terms of service,
  limitation of liability, and whether per-action pricing changes the
  risk profile.

---

## 5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POSITION

- **Defensive publication exists** (`DEFENSIVE_PUBLICATION.md`,
  November 20, 2025) covering six cybersecurity/compliance inventions.
  It does **not** cover the September 2026 matter: the emotional chain,
  the rebuilt witness panel, or the attestation receipt.
- **New matter needs a decision:** defensive publication (cheap, shield)
  vs. patent application (expensive, sword, ~$15–30k+) for the
  emotional-chain + multi-witness attestation + preserved-dissent
  combination. Note the repo is already public, which may count as
  disclosure affecting novelty.
- **Prior-art landscape (Sept 2026 research):** the phrase "emotional
  blockchain" appears in pitchware (Sentimint — no shipped product;
  LuluChain — whitepaper only) and one live product (CUDIS — on-chain
  mood logging, no attestation). None combines hash-chained entries +
  multi-witness rubric attestation + preserved dissent. Closest patent
  found: US2022/0114273A1 (blockchain + mental-state sensor data + AI;
  grant status unconfirmed). Adjacent agent-audit-trail builders
  (TrustNotch, halo-record, zta-hub) are converging on "a chain needs a
  witness" from the compliance side.
- **Name clearance:** "Goiz" (Taíno) and "Soul Cradle" should be
  searched for trademark conflicts before commercial use. The November
  package's trademark questions ("Genesis Covenant," etc.) remain open.

## 6. QUESTIONS FOR COUNSEL

1. **Entity timing.** The owner prefers not to form an entity yet and to
   sell a self-serve API as an individual. What personal liability does
   that create for attestation failures, and at what revenue or
   customer threshold does operating without an entity become
   imprudent?
2. **Terms of service.** Draft or review ToS for a per-action
   attestation API: limitation of liability, no-indemnification clause,
   service-level disclaimers, and governing law.
3. **Patent vs. defensive publication** for the September 2026 matter
   (emotional chain + witness attestation + dissent preservation),
   given the repo is already public.
4. **EU AI Act.** (a) Does "attest self-reported records, never infer
   emotions" keep the product outside the emotion-inference ban?
   (b) Can the receipt be marketed as supporting Article 12 logging
   obligations without implying conformity assessment?
5. **"Notary for AI" marketing.** Does describing the product as
   "notary-grade attestation" or "a notary for AI" risk implying
   notary licensure in any US state?
6. **IP assignment.** Review the unsigned draft at
   `Legal/IP_Assignment_Agreement.md` for use on formation day.
7. **Prior November questions** still open: dual-tier licensing
   enforceability (Genesis/Enterprise Covenant), trademark
   registrability of coined terms, and indemnification enforceability
   in EU/UK jurisdictions.

## APPENDIX A — REPO SCRUB FINDINGS

Systematic sweep completed September 25, 2026 (725 tracked files).
All findings remediated locally the same day; 28/28 will-checker tests
pass after remediation. Nothing has been pushed pending owner approval.

### Remediated

**Fabricated / unverifiable claims (2)**
- `MYTHARA_PRODUCT_SUITE_DIRECTORY.md` — "Enterprise pilot program
  (5 Fortune 500 companies)" → "Enterprise pilot program outreach"
  (no such pilot exists); "Enterprise pilot, SOC 2 certification" →
  "Enterprise pilot outreach; pursue SOC 2 certification readiness."

**Entity / certification / insurance language (12)**
- `COVENANT_INQUIRY_CODEX.md` (sales-objection script) — instructed
  presenting "Mythara Labs" as an existing engineering team with an
  existing escrow agent and tier. Rewritten as sole-proprietor framing
  with escrow/tier qualified as planned.
- `Contracts/Sole_Proprietor_Agreements/Mythara_Engine_Contract_Template.md`
  — nonexistent LLC removed as check payee, notice addressee, and
  signature-block signatory; sole proprietor only.
- `FORENSIC_CORPORATE_REVIEW_2025-11-18.md` — copyright header claimed
  by the nonexistent LLC; corrected to Herbert Velez Jr.
- `DEFENSIVE_PUBLICATION.md` — ambiguous "Herbert Velez Jr. / Mythara
  Labs LLC" clarified: LLC planned, not yet formed.
- `Commercial/one_pager.md` — sales byline presented the LLC as
  existing; corrected to sole proprietor with LLC marked planned.
- `Commercial/mythara_wellness_guardian.py` and
  `Commercial/mythara_medical_team_suite.py` — "HIPAA compliant /
  HIPAA protected" claims for local SQLite storage → "HIPAA-aligned
  safeguards; no certification claimed." (HIPAA has no certification;
  the prior wording was a regulatory overstatement, including one
  user-facing print statement.)
- `MYTHARA_ENGINE_SDK_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`,
  `MYTHARA_PORTFOLIO_SHOWCASE.md`, `MYTHARA_SOUL_CRADLE_ANALYSIS.md` —
  same HIPAA wording class, corrected the same way.
- `Legal/Federal_Compliance_Framework.md` — "federally compliant" →
  "designed to operate within U.S. regulatory boundaries."
- `COMMERCIAL_DEPLOYMENT_READINESS.md` — "Already compliant with
  emerging regulations" → "designed to adapt to emerging regulations."

**Secrets hygiene (2, no live secrets found)**
- `core/source_proprietary/security_audit_compliance.py` — test-fixture
  key renamed from `sk_live_abc123xyz789` to
  `sk_test_fixture_abc123xyz789` (no live key; avoids tripping scanners).
- `Commercial/CONTRACTOR_SYSTEM_README.md` — example passwords
  (`SecurePass2025!`) replaced with `<redacted>`.

**Third-party PII (1)**
- `MESSENGER_OUTREACH_GENESIS.md` — names, work emails, and direct
  phone numbers of third-party program managers (Booz Allen, Leidos,
  SAIC, ManTech) scraped from the NITAAC directory, plus personalized
  outreach drafts using them, removed from the public repo. Replaced
  with a pointer to the NITAAC directory and a note to keep personal
  contacts in private files only.

**Clean categories:** no live secrets anywhere in the tree; no
copyright violations (no pasted excerpts, lyrics, or unattributed
third-party code); no slurs, threats, or minor-safety issues.

### Second pass (owner-requested triple-check, same day)

The triple-check caught what the first sweep missed — fabricated
validation metrics and a direct instruction to lie to prospects:

- `COVENANT_INQUIRY_CODEX.md` — the "Who are your current customers?"
  script instructed: "We're in pilot phase with several government
  contractors and regional banks," labeled "Deflects without lying."
  It was a lie. Rewritten: pre-customer, solo-built, in validation,
  no paying customers or active pilots.
- Same file — "That's why government contractors and banks choose us"
  → "built for government contractors and banks evaluating sovereign
  AI infrastructure."
- Fabricated metrics removed from four files (`README.md`,
  `COVENANT_INQUIRY_CODEX.md`, `Commercial/one_pager.md`,
  `Commercial/seed_round/Investor_Pitch_Deck_Nov2025.md`): "100,000+
  adversarial probes — 99.98% safety recall" had no supporting
  artifact (the cited `stress_test_log.csv` does not exist; the test
  suite runs thousands of probes, not 100,000; no code computes a
  99.98% recall). "99.92% determinism" matched no report (the actual
  report shows 100/100 reproducible runs). Replaced with verifiable
  statements citing the real artifacts
  (`tests/adversarial_attack_suite.py`,
  `tests/output/determinism_report.txt`,
  `tests/output/accessibility_delivery_report.csv` — the 99.5%
  accessibility figure was verified against the CSV: 995/1000 SUCCESS).
- `Evidence/Customer_Security_Summary.md` — "In Progress: SOC 2 Type
  II, ISO 27001 certification" → "Planned (no audit initiated)"
  (no auditor is engaged).

Verification method for the triple-check: independent pattern sweeps
(certification claims, entity-as-existing language, secrets,
phone/PII, testimonials/awards, indemnification), artifact-existence
checks for every cited evidence file, and metric-to-artifact
cross-checks. Remaining "Mythara Labs LLC" mentions are either
qualified as planned, historical/diagnostic (forensic review), or
counsel questions. Remaining "fluctlight" mentions (2) are historical
references in this supplement describing the term's elimination.

### Standing warning for counsel's awareness

The untracked directory `Commercial/autonomous_outreach/` (witness-gated
outreach system, local only, not in git) contains a prospect database
with real third-party emails scraped from public sources. It must never
be committed to the public repository as-is.
