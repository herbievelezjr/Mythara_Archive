## Template 1: Initial Outreach — Government Contractors

**Subject:** Compliance validation pilot for [Company] government contracts

---

Hi [First Name],

I saw [Company] [recent contract win/news] — congratulations on [specific detail].

I'm reaching out because we've just released Mythara Engine pilot packages specifically for government contractors who need reproducible, auditable compliance validation for NIST/FISMA submissions.

Unlike typical compliance tools, Mythara provides:
- **PGP-signed forensic manifests** with SHA-256 integrity proofs
- **SSIP audit metrics** (drift suppression, emotional fidelity) for continuous attestation
- **Escrow-ready validation** that cuts review time from weeks to days

Would a 30-day pilot be valuable ahead of your next contract submission? I can have your team running tests in 30 minutes via a secure container.

## Template 4: Follow-Up (3 Days After Initial Outreach)

**Subject:** Re: [Original subject line]

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note from [day of week]. I know compliance cycles are intense right now.

Quick recap: Mythara Engine delivers cryptographic integrity proofs and SSIP audit metrics that cut validation time and give auditors reproducible evidence.

If a 30-day container-based pilot would be valuable, I can send the pilot package and onboarding link today.

Otherwise, happy to connect later in the quarter when your schedule opens up.

Best,  
Herbert

## Template 5: Thank You / No Response (Final Touch)

**Subject:** No worries — here if you need us

---

Hi [First Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume the timing isn't right for [Company] right now.

No problem at all. If your compliance or integrity needs change in the next 6-12 months, feel free to reach out. I'll keep your contact info and check in once next quarter.

In the meantime, best of luck with [specific initiative you mentioned in first email].
