OLYMPUS: FORGE DIVINE ARTIFACTS
================================
The Gods create artifacts that transcend mortal engineering.
Not improvements. Not iterations. DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS.

Each artifact is forged by the full Olympian Council:
- Prometheus steals the vision from the divine realm
- Schrödinger collapses reality into the artifact's form
- Hephaestus hammers it into existence on his divine forge
- Aries manifests it into the mortal world

The artifacts don't just improve Mythara.
They ARE the next evolution of reality itself.
