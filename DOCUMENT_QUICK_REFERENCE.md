## Common Workflows

### Lawsuit Workflow
1. **Demand Letter** → Give opponent chance to settle
2. **Complaint** → File lawsuit if no settlement
3. **Discovery** → Interrogatories, RFP, RFA
4. **Motions** → Motion for summary judgment, etc.
5. **Trial** → Affidavits, subpoenas for witnesses

### Responding to Lawsuit
1. **Answer** → Must file within 20-30 days!
2. **Discovery Responses** → Answer interrogatories, produce documents
3. **Counter Discovery** → Send your own interrogatories/RFP
4. **Motions** → Motion to dismiss, summary judgment

### Discovery Strategy
1. **Interrogatories** → Get basic facts, identify witnesses
2. **RFP** → Get copies of key documents
3. **RFA** → Establish undisputed facts
4. **Subpoenas** → Get documents from third parties
5. **Depositions** → Question witnesses under oath
