LinkedIn Outreach Planner (honest rebuild 2026-09-22)

WHAT IT DOES:
  Reads the curated prospect database (MytharaProspectDatabase), picks
  uncontacted prospects by priority, and writes personalized LinkedIn
  connection-note DRAFTS to Commercial/outreach_queue/ for Herb's approval.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO — DELIBERATELY:
  It never logs into LinkedIn, never scrapes, never clicks, never sends.
  Automated LinkedIn outreach (bots clicking Connect, auto-messaging)
  violates LinkedIn's Terms of Service and risks a permanent restriction
  of the user's LinkedIn account. This module is architecturally incapable
  of it: there is no browser, no session, no credentials anywhere here.
  Herb reads each draft and sends every connection himself.

Prospect source: Commercial/mythara_prospect_database.py (Herb's curated
target list — company-level research, not verified individual leads).
