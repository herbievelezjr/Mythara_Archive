🚨 The OCC just updated SR 11-7 guidance on AI model risk management.

Here's what every bank needs to know:

1️⃣ Tamper-evident audit trails are now EXPECTED (not optional)
2️⃣ Cryptographic hashing of model inputs/outputs
3️⃣ Full lineage tracking from training data → production deployment

Most banks are still using spreadsheets and manual documentation. 😬

That's why we built Mythara — automated model governance that auditors actually accept.

Same rigor, 75% faster.

If you're in banking/fintech and dealing with model risk management, let's talk.

📊 Illustrative Example (hypothetical): How a Bank Could Cut AI Validation Time by 75%

The Challenge:
   - 6 weeks to validate each AI model
   - Manual documentation (spreadsheets, emails)
   - Auditors questioned integrity

The Solution (Mythara):
   - Cryptographic hashing of all model artifacts
   - Tamper-evident audit trail
   - Automated compliance reporting

The Results:
   ✅ 6 weeks → 8 days (75% faster)
   ✅ Zero audit findings (auditors loved the crypto seals)
   ✅ 3 models deployed vs 1 in same timeframe

The secret? We don't replace your process. We make it auditable.
