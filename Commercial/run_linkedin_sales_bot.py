"""
LinkedIn Sales Bot — QUARANTINED Selenium attempt (2026-09-22).

⚠️  READ BEFORE RUNNING:
  - WINDOWS ONLY. It drives Microsoft Edge through Herb's own logged-in
    Windows user profile (hardcoded path below). It cannot run on Linux,
    macOS, or any server.
  - REQUIRES THE USER'S OWN SESSION. It automates Herb's personal LinkedIn
    login. Never point it at anyone else's account.
  - ACCOUNT RISK IS REAL. Automated connection requests and messaging
    violate LinkedIn's Terms of Service. LinkedIn detects automation and
    restricts or permanently bans accounts. "Safe limits" and random
    delays reduce but do not remove this risk.
  - NEVER RUN FROM A DATACENTER / VPN / SERVER IP. Automation from a
    datacenter IP is one of the strongest bot signals. Only run from
    Herb's own home machine on his normal residential IP.
  - XPaths are brittle and WILL rot as LinkedIn changes its markup.

Kept because the Connect-clicking flow is a genuine attempt worth
preserving — but it is not a production tool. The honest LinkedIn path
is Commercial/mythara_linkedin_automation_bot.py (planner: drafts only,
human sends).
