**SALES PSYCHOLOGY FRAMEWORK (JEVONS EFFECT MODEL):**

1. JEVONS EFFECT (SCARCITY  PERCEIVED VALUE):
   - LIMITED SUPPLY TRIGGERS: "Only 3 early adopter slots left" (not "limited time offer")
   - CONSTRAINED ACCESS: "I can only onboard 5 companies this quarter" (capacity constraint, not fake scarcity)
   - COMPETITIVE PRESSURE: "2 other banks in your region are evaluating this week"
   - EXCLUSIVITY FRAME: "Most companies don't qualify for $500 pricingyou do because of [specific reason]"
   
2. FEAR OF LOSS (LOSS AVERSION > GAIN SEEKING):
   - REGULATORY RISK: "Your next CFPB audit without this = $500k-$5M fine exposure"
   - COMPETITIVE LOSS: "While you evaluate, competitors are building auditable AI advantage"
   - OPPORTUNITY COST: "Every week without this = 20+ hours of manual audit prep you can't get back"
   - PRICING LOSS: "$500 expires Friday. After that it's $2,500 (I can't make exceptions)"
   - SOCIAL PROOF LOSS: "The 3 banks already piloting will have 6 months of validated data before you start"

3. SENSE OF URGENCY (TIME COMPRESSION):
   - EXTERNAL DEADLINES: "Fed AI governance rules effective Q2 2026setup takes 60 days"
   - INTERNAL CONSTRAINTS: "I'm booking December pilots this week. After Friday I'm locked until February"
   - PRICING WINDOWS: "$500 pricing ends when I hit 20 customers (currently at 17)"
   - EVENT-DRIVEN: "Your audit is in 6 weekswe can have validation reports ready in 10 days"
   - MOMENTUM LOSS: "The longer you wait, the less historical data you'll have for your first audit"

4. STRATEGIC INDIFFERENCE (TAKEAWAY SELLING):
   - NOT CONVINCING, QUALIFYING: "This might not be a fit if you don't have regulatory pressure right now"
   - WILLING TO WALK: "If timing's not right, totally understand. I'll check back in Q2"
   - SELECTIVE AVAILABILITY: "I'm prioritizing companies with audits in next 90 daysis that you?"
   - PEER PRESSURE: "Most banks need model risk committee approval first. Do you have that authority or should I talk to someone else?"
   - HIGH-STATUS POSITIONING: "I only work with teams that can move fast. Can you decide this week or do you need more approvals?"

5. OBJECTION REFRAMING (INDIFFERENCE + LOSS):
   - "Too expensive"  "Compared to what? A CFPB fine? A failed audit? 200 hours of manual work?"
   - "Need time to think"  "Totally fair. Just know the $500 window closes Friday and I might be booked by the time you circle back"
   - "Already have logs"  "That's greatthis replaces them with cryptographic proof. But if your current solution passes audits, you probably don't need this"
   - "Not priority"  "Got it. Out of curiosity, when's your next model risk review? [If soon] Ah, then you might want this sooner than you think"
   
6. TONE CALIBRATION:
   - Confident, not arrogant
   - Helpful, not needy  
   - Scarce, not desperate
   - Indifferent to outcome, obsessed with fit
   - "I don't chaseI qualify and close"

7. CLOSING MECHANICS:
   - ASSUMPTIVE: "I'll send the calendar invite for Tuesday 2pmdoes that work or is Wednesday better?"
   - ALTERNATIVE CHOICE: "Do you want the full audit module or just agent override tracking to start?"
   - URGENCY STACK: "If you commit by Friday: $500 price + priority onboarding + I'll personally run your first audit report"
   - TAKEAWAY CLOSE: "If you're not 100% sure, let's not waste time. I'd rather you be certain this solves your problem"
