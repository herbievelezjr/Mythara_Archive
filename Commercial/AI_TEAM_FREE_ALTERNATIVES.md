# 🆓 AI Team - Free/Low-Cost Alternatives

**Problem:** OpenAI API costs $200-300/month for all 6 bots  
**Solution:** Use free/cheaper alternatives until revenue justifies GPT-4

---

## Option 1: Manual Mode (Free)

Run bots manually when needed instead of automated:

```powershell
# Run Marketing Bot when you want leads
py -3.11 run_marketing_bot.py

# Run Sales Trainer Bot weekly
py -3.11 run_sales_trainer_bot.py
```

**Disable automated scheduling:**
```powershell
# Disable hourly Marketing Bot
schtasks /change /tn "Mythara Marketing Bot" /disable

# Disable 6-hour Sales Trainer Bot
schtasks /change /tn "Mythara Sales Trainer Bot" /disable

# Keep weekly report enabled (uses minimal API calls)
# schtasks /change /tn "Mythara Weekly Report" /enable
```

**Cost:** $0/month (run manually as needed)

---

## Option 2: Use Free AI APIs

Replace OpenAI with free alternatives:

### Google Gemini (Free Tier)

- **Quality:** Nearly as good as GPT-4
- **Setup:**
  1. Go to: https://ai.google.dev/
  2. Get free API key
  3. Set: `$env:GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_KEY'`

### Anthropic Claude (Free Trial)
- **Free:** $5 credit (lasts ~1 month for light use)
- **Quality:** Excellent for analysis
- **Setup:**
  1. Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/
  2. Get API key
  3. Set: `$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = 'YOUR_KEY'`

### Groq (Free)
- **Free:** Unlimited (with rate limits)
- **Quality:** Good for simple tasks
- **Speed:** Very fast

  1. Go to: https://console.groq.com/
  2. Get API key
  3. Set: `$env:GROQ_API_KEY = 'YOUR_KEY'`

**Cost:** $0-5/month

---

## Option 3: Rule-Based Bots (No AI Needed)

Simplify bots to use rules instead of GPT-4:

### Marketing Bot (Rule-Based):
```python
def score_lead_simple(lead):
    score = 0
    
    # Industry fit
    if lead['industry'] in ['Banking', 'Healthcare', 'Insurance']:
        score += 40
    
    # Company size
    if lead['revenue'] == '>$100M':
        score += 30
    elif lead['revenue'] == '$50M-$100M':
        score += 20
    
    # Engagement
    score += lead['email_opens'] * 5
    score += lead['link_clicks'] * 10
    
    return min(score, 100)
```

### Sales Trainer Bot (Rule-Based):
```python
def analyze_conversation_simple(conversation):
    patterns = []
    
    # Check for common winning patterns
    if 'compliance' in conversation['messages']:
        patterns.append('compliance_language_works')
    
    if 'discount' in conversation['messages'] and conversation['outcome'] == 'lost':
        patterns.append('discount_language_loses')
    
    if conversation['response_time'] < 24:
        patterns.append('fast_response_wins')
    
    return patterns
```

**Cost:** $0/month (pure Python logic)

---

## Option 4: Pay-As-You-Go OpenAI

Use OpenAI but minimize costs:

### Strategies:
1. **Use GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4** (10x cheaper)
   - Cost: ~$20-30/month instead of $200-300
   - Quality: 80% as good for most tasks

2. **Batch API calls** (50% discount)
   - Process leads in batches instead of real-time
   - Results delivered within 24 hours

3. **Run bots less frequently**
   - Marketing Bot: Daily instead of hourly
   - Sales Trainer Bot: Weekly instead of every 6 hours

4. **Use AI only for critical decisions**
   - Score leads with rules
   - Use GPT-4 only for final analysis

**Cost:** $20-50/month

## Recommended Approach (Start Free, Scale Up)

### Phase 1: Free (Now - First $5k MRR)
- Use **Google Gemini** free tier
- Run bots **manually** when needed
- Use **rule-based** scoring where possible
- Focus on closing deals manually

### Phase 2: Low-Cost ($5k-$20k MRR)
- Upgrade to **GPT-3.5** ($20-30/month)
- Run Marketing Bot **daily** instead of hourly
- Automate Sales Trainer Bot **weekly**
- Invest 1% of revenue in AI (~$50-200/month)

### Phase 3: Full Power ($20k+ MRR)
- Upgrade to **GPT-4** ($200-300/month)
- Run all 6 bots fully automated
- Add Google Ads budget ($5k/month)
- ROI justifies investment

---

## Quick Setup: Google Gemini (Free)

```powershell
# 1. Get free API key from https://ai.google.dev/
# 2. Set environment variable
$env:GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY = 'YOUR_FREE_KEY'

# 3. Test it works
py -3.11 -c "import os; print('✅ Google AI API key set' if os.getenv('GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY') else '❌ Not set')"
```

## Modified Bot Code (Use Gemini Instead of OpenAI)

I can update your bots to use Google Gemini (free) instead of OpenAI (paid).

**Changes needed:**
- `run_marketing_bot.py`: Replace OpenAI calls with Gemini
- `run_sales_trainer_bot.py`: Replace OpenAI calls with Gemini
- Cost: $0/month instead of $200/month

**Want me to make these changes?**

## Bottom Line

**Don't let API costs block you.**

Start with:
1. ✅ **Google Gemini (free)** - Good enough for 80% of use cases
2. ✅ **Manual bot runs** - Run when you need them
3. ✅ **Rule-based logic** - No AI needed for scoring

Upgrade to GPT-4 when you're making $20k+ MRR and the ROI is clear.

**Your bots are already built. We just need to swap the AI engine.**

**What would you like to do?**

A. Update bots to use Google Gemini (free)  
B. Simplify to rule-based bots (no AI)  
C. Keep as-is and run manually when needed  
D. Wait until you have budget for OpenAI
