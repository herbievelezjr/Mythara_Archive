## W-9 Instructions

When a customer asks for a W-9 (they will for accounts payable):

1. **Download blank W-9** from IRS.gov: https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf
2. **Fill it out:**
   - **Name:** Herbert Velez Jr.
   - **Business name:** Leave blank (or write "Mythara Engine — Sole Proprietorship")
   - **Tax classification:** Check "Individual/sole proprietor"
   - **Address:** Your home address
   - **SSN:** Your Social Security Number (Part I, box 2)
   - **Sign and date**
3. **Save as PDF:** `W9_Herbert_Velez_Jr_2025.pdf`
4. **Send to customer** (usually AP team or procurement)

**Security note:** Only send W-9 to verified customers who are paying you. Never post publicly.

## Payment Methods Ranked (Fastest to Slowest)

| Method | Speed | Fees | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zelle | Same day | $0 | Small deals ($500–$2,500) |
| ACH/Wire | 1–3 days | $0–$25 | Enterprise ($2,500+) |
| Check | 5–10 days | $0 | Old-school companies |
| PayPal | Same day | 3% | Last resort |
| Credit card (Stripe) | 2–3 days | 2.9% + $0.30 | If you set up Stripe (optional) |

**Recommendation for now:**
- **$500–$2,500:** Accept Zelle or ACH (no fees, fast)
- **$2,500+:** ACH or wire only (more professional)
- Avoid PayPal unless customer insists (3% hurts margins)

---

## Invoice Numbering System

Format: `INV-[YYYYMMDD]-[Sequential Number]`

Examples:
- First invoice: `INV-20251104-001`
- Second invoice (same day): `INV-20251104-002`
- Next day: `INV-20251105-001`

Keep a simple tracking sheet:

| Invoice # | Date | Customer | Amount | Status | Paid Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| INV-20251104-001 | 11/4/25 | Western Union | $2,500 | Sent | |
| INV-20251104-002 | 11/4/25 | Ping Identity | $500 | Sent | |

## What to Do When Customer Says "We Need a Contract"

Some customers (especially enterprise) will say: "We need a licensing agreement before we can pay."

**Fast response (copy-paste):**

> "Absolutely — I can send you our standard Development License Agreement. It covers:
> - Non-exclusive commercial use rights
> - 30-day evaluation period
> - Source code access (private GitHub repo invite)
> - Support via email
> - No liability for pilot/eval use
> 
> I can send it as a PDF or Word doc — whichever your legal team prefers. Most customers sign and return within 1–2 days.
> 
> Would you like me to send that over now?"

**Then use the agreement template in `Licensee_Packet/Development_License_Agreement_Template.md`** (if it exists — if not, I can create one).

---

## When Customer Asks "Do You Have a Business Bank Account?"

**Honest answer (for now):**

> "I'm operating as a sole proprietor right now, so payments go to my personal account under Herbert Velez Jr. I can accept ACH, wire, Zelle, or check — whichever works best for your AP team.
> 
> Once we close a few more deals, I'll be forming an LLC and opening a business account. But for your procurement team, the W-9 and invoice with my SSN is totally standard for sole proprietor software licensing."

**Most B2B customers don't care** — they pay freelancers and consultants (sole props) all the time. The W-9 makes it legitimate.

---

## When to Form the LLC

Wait until you hit **$25k–$50k in revenue** (10–20 deals), then:

1. **File LLC in Colorado:** $50 online at sos.state.co.us
2. **Get EIN from IRS:** Free at irs.gov (takes 5 minutes)
3. **Open business bank account:** Chase, BoA, or local credit union
4. **Update invoices/W-9** to use LLC name and EIN instead of SSN

Until then, **sole proprietorship is fine and saves you $500–$1,000** in setup costs.
