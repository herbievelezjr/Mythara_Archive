Proposal Drafter — real leaf executor for the VP's freelance campaign.

Takes a gig posting (title, description, budget) and returns a tailored
proposal draft built from the freelance kit templates
(~/workspace/your_files/freelance_kit/proposals/).

Hard rules:
- NEVER invents clients, metrics, certifications, credentials, or results.
  Only the gig's own words and the kit's verified template text go in.
- Every draft is scanned against the will's forbidden-claim patterns
  (soul_cradle.will). A match raises FabricatedClaimError — the draft is
  refused, not cleaned up.
- [Brackets] the drafter cannot fill honestly are left for Herb.
- This module drafts only. It cannot send anything, anywhere.

Template selection is keyword-based and deterministic: email/inbox/gmail ->
email automation; chatbot/faq/website -> chatbot; hipaa/fda/health/compliance
-> compliance readiness; anything else -> general AI audit.

    "email": """**Hook:**
Your inbox is costing you hours a week. I build Gmail automation that triages incoming mail and drafts replies for you to approve — nothing ever sends without you.

**What I deliver:**
- Gmail API connection to your account (you keep full control, revoke anytime)
- Incoming mail sorted by intent — sales, support, spam, needs-you-now
- Auto-drafted replies you review and send in one click
- Simple rules you can change yourself (no code needed)
- Short handoff doc + 30-min walkthrough call

**Timeline:** 5–7 days from when you grant Gmail access.

**Call to action:**
Want to see it working first? I'll do a 15-minute call and screen-share a live demo of the email bot drafting real replies. No charge, no pitch — if it's not useful, we shake hands and move on.

    "chatbot": """**Hook:**
Your customers ask the same questions every day. I'll build a chatbot trained on your business info that answers them on your website — and hands off to a human when it doesn't know.

**What I deliver:**
- Chatbot trained on your FAQ, services, and docs (you provide the material)
- Embeds on your website with your branding
- "I don't know" fallback that routes to you or your contact form — it never guesses
- Basic log of what visitors asked, so you learn what they want
- Short handoff doc + 30-min walkthrough call

**Timeline:** 10–14 days from when you send me your content.

**Call to action:**
I'll show you a working chatbot on a 15-minute call and answer straight questions about what it can and can't do. If it's not a fit, I'll tell you — I'd rather lose the job than sell you something useless.

    "compliance": """**Hook:**
If you handle health data or build health tech, you need to know where you stand before an auditor tells you. I run a structured HIPAA / FDA 21 CFR Part 11 readiness review and hand you a gap report with fixes in priority order.

**What I deliver:**
- Checklist-based review of your systems against HIPAA and/or FDA 21 CFR Part 11 controls
- Hash-verified written report: what's covered, what's missing, what to fix first
- 30-min walkthrough call to go through the findings

**Timeline:** 3–5 days from when you give me access to your docs/systems.

**One-line disclaimer (do not remove):**
I'm not a lawyer or a certified auditor, and this isn't certification — it's a readiness assessment that shows your gaps so you can fix them before a real audit.

**Call to action:**
I'll show you a sample report format on a 15-minute call so you know exactly what you'd get. No charge for the call.

    "audit": """**Hook:**
Everyone says "use AI." Almost nobody tells you where it actually pays off in your business. I'll audit your workflows and give you a build-vs-skip plan — what's worth automating, what isn't, and what it'd cost.

**What I deliver:**
- 45-min working session to map where your team loses time
- Written audit: 3–5 concrete automation opportunities, ranked by payoff vs. effort
- Honest "don't bother" list — the things AI would do badly in your business
- Rough cost/timeline for each opportunity, whether you hire me or not

**Timeline:** 1 week from the working session.

**Call to action:**
The audit itself is the product — you keep the plan even if we never work together again. Want to start with a free 15-minute call to see if there's enough here to audit?
