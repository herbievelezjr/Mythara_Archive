"""
Sales Trainer Bot runner — honest rebuild 2026-09-22.

WHAT IT DOES:
  Runs the SalesTrainerBot's real rule-based conversation analysis
  over a set of conversations and prints the lessons it derives.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO:
  - The conversations below are ILLUSTRATIVE SAMPLES, not real
    customer data. Any "tactics to amplify/retire" below is derived
    from 3 made-up examples — treat it as a demo of the analysis,
    not as sales advice.
  - update_sales_bot_tactics() only LOGS. It modifies no sales bot.
    The tactic-update path is not implemented.
