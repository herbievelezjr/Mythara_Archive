# ARCHITECTURE
# =============================================================================

"""
CALL FLOW:

1. Trigger:
   - Email bot gets "interested" response
   - OR Prospect clicks "Schedule Call" link
   - OR Manual trigger for high-value leads

2. Pre-Call Setup:
   - Bot generates call script (industry-adapted)
   - Mythara validates script (governance check)
   - Twilio initiates call from (your number)

3. During Call:
   - AI voice greets prospect (ElevenLabs voice)
   - Bot listens to responses (OpenAI Whisper STT)
   - Bot responds in real-time (sales tactics + industry tone)
   - Mythara logs entire conversation (audit trail)

4. Post-Call:
   - If meeting booked: Send calendar invite (Google Calendar API)
   - If not interested: Add to quarterly cycle
   - If needs follow-up: Generate email with call summary
   - Update blessings reservoir (+10 if successful, -5 if failed)
   - Log to analytics (call duration, outcome, next action)

5. Compliance:
   - Record call if legally required (varies by state)
   - Provide opt-out mechanism ("Press 1 to be removed")
   - Log consent in TCPA compliance database

# =============================================================================
# COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)
# =============================================================================

COMPLIANCE = """
⚖️ TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act) Requirements:

1. PRIOR EXPRESS WRITTEN CONSENT required for:
   - Calls using artificial/prerecorded voice
   - Calls to cell phones
   - PENALTY: $500-$1,500 PER CALL if violated

2. How to Get Consent:
   - Email: "Reply YES to receive a call about Mythara"
   - Website: Checkbox "I consent to receive calls from Mythara"
   - Form: "By submitting, you agree to receive calls"
   
3. Do-Not-Call Registry:
   - Maintain internal DNC list
   - Honor opt-out requests immediately
   - Check National DNC registry (costs $66/area code)

4. Call Recording:
   - Varies by state (11 states require two-party consent)
   - Announce: "This call may be recorded for quality assurance"
   - Store recordings securely (GDPR/CCPA compliance)

5. Identification:
   - Bot must identify itself as AI (FTC guidance)
   - Provide company name and callback number
   - Disclose purpose of call upfront

📋 Required Disclosures:
   "Hi, this is the Mythara AI assistant calling on behalf of Herbert Velez. 
    This call may be recorded. I'm reaching out about AI governance solutions 
    for [COMPANY]. Do you have 2 minutes?"

🚨 HIGH RISK AREAS:
   - Banking/Healthcare: Extra scrutiny (may require human-only calls)
   - Cold calls: Higher complaint risk
   - Cell phones: TCPA exposure

💡 RECOMMENDATION:
   - Start with WARM LEADS ONLY (people who replied to email)
   - Get explicit consent: "Can I give you a call to discuss?"
   - Use human calls for first deals, then automate
"""

# =============================================================================
# INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS
# =============================================================================

INTEGRATION = """
🔗 How VoIP Bot Integrates with Current Stack:

1. Email Bot (Existing):
   - Prospect replies "interested" to email
   - Email bot asks: "Would you prefer a quick call? Reply YES for callback"
   - If YES → Trigger VoIP bot

2. Sales Bot with Soul (Existing):
   - Use same industry detection (banking/healthcare/tech)
   - Use same sales tactics (scarcity, urgency, competitive pressure)
   - Use same personality (relationship-first + aggressive closing)
   - Adapt for voice: Shorter sentences, conversational tone

3. Mythara Governance (Existing):
   - Validate call scripts before dialing
   - Check pricing rules (don't quote <$500)
   - Check compliance rules (don't claim FDA approved)
   - Log conversation to audit trail (SHA-256 hash)
   - Update blessings reservoir based on call outcome

4. Analytics Dashboard (Existing):
   - Add call metrics: duration, outcome, script used
   - Track call → meeting conversion rate
   - Compare email vs call effectiveness
   - Weekly report includes voice performance

5. Quarterly Cycling (Existing):
   - If call ends in "not interested" → Add to 90-day cycle
   - Re-engage via email first, then offer call option
