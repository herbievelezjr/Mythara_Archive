"""
Runner for the Affiliate Tracker.

Approves pending affiliate payouts that cleared the $50 threshold and
prints the program report.

Honest contract: APPROVAL is not PAYMENT. This bot moves no money —
there is no PayPal/Stripe API here. Every "approved" payout still
needs Herb to send it manually via PayPal. Status: approved_for_payout.
