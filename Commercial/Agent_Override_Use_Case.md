# Agent Override with Accountability — Use Case & Demo Flow

## The Problem (Why Customers Care)

### Banking/Lending Scenario

**Current state (without Mythara):**
1. AI model flags loan application as "high risk" → automatically denies
2. Senior underwriter reviews → sees good customer with 10-year history
3. Underwriter overrides AI decision → approves loan manually
4. **6 months later:** Loan defaults
5. **Audit asks:** "Who approved this risky loan?"
6. **Answer:** "The system approved it" or "I don't know, it was in the queue"
7. **Result:** Entire team gets penalized, good agents blamed alongside bad agents

**Pain points:**
- ❌ No accountability trail (can't prove who overrode AI)
- ❌ Good agents penalized for bad agents' decisions
- ❌ Regulators don't trust the override process
- ❌ AI stays too conservative (blocks good customers to avoid blame)

---

## The Solution (Mythara's Agent Override Clause)

### With Mythara SSIP:
1. AI model flags loan → **cryptographically logged**
2. Underwriter reviews → sees mitigating factors
3. Underwriter clicks "Override" → **enters justification** (min 50 chars)
4. **Mythara logs:**
   - Agent ID (Jane Doe, #5432)
   - Timestamp (2025-11-04 14:32:18)
   - AI risk score (0.78)
   - Override decision (APPROVE)
   - Justification ("Verified income via tax returns, 10-year customer, low debt-to-income")
   - **Integrity hash** (SHA-256, tamper-evident)
5. Loan approved → **agent is on record**
6. **6 months later:** Loan defaults
7. **Audit pulls invocation:** `INV-2025-11-04-00834`
8. **Proof shows:** Jane Doe overrode AI at 2:32pm with specific justification
9. **Accountability:** Jane's override rate tracked (if 60% fail → coaching; if 90% succeed → promotion)

**Value delivered:**
- ✅ Full accountability (agent can't blame "the system")
- ✅ Good agents protected (their override success rate proves good judgment)
- ✅ Bad agents identified (pattern of failed overrides)
- ✅ Regulators satisfied (cryptographic audit trail)
- ✅ AI learns from edge cases (successful overrides = training data)

---

## Technical Implementation

### Clause Invocation (Python API)

```python
from mythara import invoke_clause

# Agent overrides AI risk flag
override_result = invoke_clause(
    clause_name="Risk_Override_Authority",
    context={
        "flagged_application_id": "APP-12345",
        "ai_risk_score": 0.78,
        "ai_flags": ["income_mismatch", "short_employment"],
        "agent_id": "AGENT-5432",
        "agent_name": "Jane Doe",
        "agent_justification": "Verified income via tax returns, 10-year customer relationship, low debt-to-income ratio",
        "override_authority_level": "Senior_Underwriter"
    },
    messenger_pairing=("Governance", "Accountability")
)

# Response includes accountability trail
{
    "decision": "APPROVED_VIA_OVERRIDE",
    "invocation_id": "INV-2025-11-04-00834",
    "agent_id": "AGENT-5432",
    "integrity_hash": "sha256:a3f2e9c8b7d6...",
    "audit_trail": {
        "agent_liable": True,
        "override_timestamp": "2025-11-04T14:32:18Z",
        "ai_recommendation": "DENY",
        "agent_decision": "APPROVE",
        "justification": "Verified income via tax returns...",
        "tamper_evident": True
    },
    "ssip_compliance": {
        "drift_suppression": 0.992,
        "emotional_fidelity": 0.94,
        "explainability": "Full clause-level audit trail available"
    }
}
```

### Audit Query (6 Months Later)

```python
# Compliance team queries all overrides for defaulted loans
audit_results = query_invocations(
    filters={
        "clause_name": "Risk_Override_Authority",
        "application_id": "APP-12345",
        "outcome": "DEFAULT"
    }
)

# Returns immutable log:
{
    "invocation_id": "INV-2025-11-04-00834",
    "agent_id": "AGENT-5432",
    "agent_name": "Jane Doe",
    "override_timestamp": "2025-11-04T14:32:18Z",
    "ai_recommendation": "DENY (risk score 0.78)",
    "agent_decision": "APPROVE",
    "justification": "Verified income via tax returns, 10-year customer...",
    "integrity_hash": "sha256:a3f2e9c8b7d6...",
    "hash_verified": True,  # Proves log wasn't tampered with
    "regulatory_note": "Agent AGENT-5432 liable per SSIP accountability policy"
}
```

### Agent Performance Tracking

```python
# HR/Compliance dashboard: Agent override success rate
agent_stats = get_agent_override_stats("AGENT-5432")

{
    "agent_id": "AGENT-5432",
    "agent_name": "Jane Doe",
    "total_overrides": 47,
    "successful_overrides": 42,  # Loan paid off
    "failed_overrides": 5,        # Loan defaulted
    "success_rate": 0.894,        # 89.4%
    "recommendation": "PROMOTE",  # High success rate = good judgment
    "risk_adjusted_value": "+$1.2M"  # Net value of approved loans
}
```

## Use Cases Beyond Banking

### 1. Healthcare — Clinical AI Override
**Scenario:** AI recommends against surgery (high risk score)
- Surgeon reviews patient history → sees mitigating factors
- Surgeon overrides AI → performs surgery
- **If patient dies:** Audit shows surgeon's justification + accountability
- **If patient survives:** Surgeon gets credit for judgment call

**Value:** Protects hospital from liability, proves clinical decision-making process

---

### 2. Gaming — Content Moderation Override
**Scenario:** AI flags post as "hate speech"
- Moderator reviews → sees it's satirical quote from a book
- Moderator overrides AI → post stays up
- **If user appeals:** Audit shows moderator's justification
- **If moderator has 95% override accuracy:** Gets promoted to senior mod

**Value:** Trust & Safety teams can override AI without losing accountability

---

### 3. Cybersecurity — Threat Detection Override
**Scenario:** AI blocks legitimate partner's IP as "suspicious"
- Security analyst reviews → sees it's scheduled vendor maintenance
- Analyst overrides block → allows traffic
- **If breach occurs:** Audit shows analyst approved override
- **If no breach:** Analyst gets credit for reducing false positives

**Value:** Security teams can move fast without losing forensic trail

---

## Sales Pitch (How to Present This)

### Opening (Problem)
> "Your underwriters need the flexibility to override AI decisions — customers with complex situations get unfairly denied. But when those overrides go bad, you can't prove who approved what. Regulators see a black box. Good agents get blamed alongside bad agents."

### Solution (Mythara)
> "Mythara gives you **accountability + flexibility**. Every override is cryptographically logged with the agent's ID, timestamp, and justification. If the loan defaults, your audit shows exactly who approved it and why. If it succeeds, the agent gets credit. Good agents get promoted, bad agents get coached. Regulators see full transparency."

### Demo (Show This Flow)
> "Let me show you. AI flags a loan — risk score 0.78. Your senior underwriter reviews it, sees 10 years of customer history, verified income. She clicks Override, enters her justification. Mythara logs her ID, the AI's score, her reasoning — all hashed and tamper-evident.
>
> Six months later, if that loan defaults, your audit pulls the invocation. You see: 'Jane Doe overrode AI on Nov 4 at 2:32pm.' She can't say 'the system approved it' — her name is on it. But if 90% of her overrides succeed, she gets promoted. **That's accountability.**"

### Close (ROI)
> "You get faster approvals, better risk management, and regulatory compliance. Your good agents are protected. Your bad agents are identified. And you have cryptographic proof for every decision. **That's the value of SSIP + Mythara.**"

## Pricing Impact

### What to Charge

**Standard Development License:** $2,500  
**With Agent Override Module:** $5,000 (add-on)  
**Enterprise (500+ agents):** $50k–$100k (includes training, integration, compliance support)

**Why they'll pay:**
- **Risk reduction:** Avoid regulatory fines (CFPB, OCC, FDIC can fine $1M+ for lack of accountability)
- **Agent productivity:** Good agents make more decisions (10-15% faster)
- **Legal protection:** Cryptographic proof in litigation
- **AI improvement:** Override data = training data for next model version

## Add to Your Outreach Templates

### Template A Update (Model Risk Buyers)

**NEW SECTION TO ADD:**

> **Agent Override Accountability:**  
> Your underwriters can override AI flags with full cryptographic audit trails. Every override logs the agent's ID, justification, and timestamp — immutably. If the loan defaults, you know exactly who approved it. If it succeeds, the agent gets credit. Good agents protected, bad agents identified. Regulators love it.
