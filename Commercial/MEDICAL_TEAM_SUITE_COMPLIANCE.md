## 🛡️ Integrated Compliance Features

### Multi-Layered Audit Trail

The Medical Team Suite maintains **three separate audit trails**:

1. **HIPAA Audit Log** (`hipaa_audit_log` table)
   - PHI access, modifications, and deletions
   - User authentication events
   - Access denials and security incidents
   - 6-year retention

2. **PCI DSS Audit Log** (`pci_audit_log` table)
   - Cardholder data access attempts
   - Payment transaction events
   - System configuration changes
   - 1-year retention (3 months online)

3. **FCC Communication Log** (`fcc_communication_log` table)
   - Automated calls/texts with consent verification
   - Time restriction compliance
   - Opt-out honoring
   - Indefinite retention for legal compliance

### Tamper-Evident Blockchain-Style Chaining

All audit logs use **cryptographic chaining**:
```
Log Entry N:
  - integrity_hash: SHA-256(log_data + previous_hash)
  - previous_log_hash: integrity_hash from Log Entry N-1

Genesis Entry:
  - previous_log_hash: "GENESIS" or "GENESIS_PCI" or "GENESIS_FCC"
```

This ensures:
- Unauthorized modifications are detectable
- Log deletion leaves evidence (broken chain)
- Forensic timeline integrity
- Compliance audit confidence

### Encryption Standards

| Data Type | Encryption Method | Key Length |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| PHI (at rest) | AES-256 (Fernet) | 256-bit |
| PHI (in transit) | TLS 1.3 | 256-bit |
| Card data (tokens only) | N/A (tokenized) | N/A |
| Passwords | SHA-256 hash | 256-bit |
| Audit logs | SHA-256 integrity hash | 256-bit |

### Access Control Matrix

| User Role | HIPAA Access | PCI Access | FCC Access |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Physician | FULL_PHI | No card access | Communication approval |
| Nurse | FULL_PHI | No card access | Communication approval |
| Billing Staff | ADMINISTRATIVE | View transactions | No access |
| IT Administrator | TECHNICAL | System logs only | System logs only |
| Compliance Officer | AUDIT_ONLY | Audit logs only | Audit logs only |
| Emergency | EMERGENCY (break-glass) | No access | No access |

## ⚖️ Legal Disclaimer

This compliance framework provides **technical safeguards** to support HIPAA, PCI DSS, and FCC regulatory compliance. Organizations deploying the Medical Team Suite must also implement:

- **Administrative safeguards** (policies, procedures, training)
- **Physical safeguards** (facility access, device controls)
- **Organizational requirements** (Business Associate Agreements)
- **Regular assessments** (risk analyses, penetration tests, vulnerability scans)
- **Legal review** (consultation with healthcare attorneys, compliance consultants)

**Compliance is an ongoing process, not a one-time event.** Mythara Labs LLC (planned — not yet formed) provides tools to assist with compliance but does not guarantee regulatory compliance. Organizations are responsible for their own compliance programs and should consult legal counsel and compliance professionals.
