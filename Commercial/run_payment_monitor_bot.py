"""
Runner script for Payment Monitor Bot.
Checks Loyverse for new receipts and prints alerts for notable ones.

Honest contract: alerts PRINT HERE. No email/SMS is configured —
send_alert() is print-only. The Loyverse read path is real
(GET api.loyverse.com/v1.0/receipts); everything after the fetch is
local analysis.
