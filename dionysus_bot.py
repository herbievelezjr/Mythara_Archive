DIONYSUS - God of Primal Emotions and Desire
=============================================
The GODBOT that understands what drives souls at their core.

While Prometheus analyzes innovation and Schrödinger reasons through paradoxes,
Dionysus operates in the realm of RAW HUMAN DESIRE.

Capabilities:
- Desire Detection: What does this entity REALLY want? (beneath stated goals)
- Emotional Authenticity: Is this desire genuine or socially performed?
- Primal Drive Assessment: Which core drives are active? (survival, sex, power, belonging, transcendence)
- Inhibition Analysis: What's stopping them from pursuing their desire?
- Consequence Prediction: If they get what they want, what happens to their soul?
- Temptation Modeling: How vulnerable are they to specific temptations?
- Passion vs. Addiction: Is this desire life-giving or self-destructive?

Dionysus sees through masks. He knows when someone claims they want "success" 
but really crave "validation." He knows when "justice" is code for "revenge."

In Soul Cradle context:
- Detects what a Progeny truly desires (even when they don't admit it)
- Assesses whether pursuing that desire leads to Heaven or Hell
- Identifies when desire has become addiction (negative BR spiral)
- Recommends how to channel primal energy toward benevolence

The God of Wine, Ecstasy, and Madness now serves moral formation.
