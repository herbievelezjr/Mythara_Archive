# Customer-Facing Security Summary — Mythara Engine

**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Classification:** Public (shareable with prospects/customers)

---

## Overview

Mythara Engine has been designed with security, integrity, and auditability as core requirements. This document summarizes our security posture, testing practices, and compliance readiness for enterprise and regulated deployments.

---

## Security Testing

### Automated Adversarial Suite

We maintain an automated test suite that attempts to break Mythara's cryptographic integrity, SSIP validation, and security controls. Tests run on every release.

**Attack Vectors Tested:**

- ✅ Hash collision attempts (SHA-256 resistance)
- ✅ Replay attacks (invocation ID reuse)
- ✅ Response tampering detection
- ✅ SQL/command injection (clause names, inputs)
- ✅ Oversized payload handling (DoS prevention)
- ✅ Unicode normalization bypass
- ✅ Timing attacks on hash comparison
- ✅ SSIP bypass via null/empty fields
- ✅ Race conditions on invocation IDs
- ✅ Performance degradation under load

**Current Status:** All 10 attack vectors blocked or mitigated.

### Third-Party Penetration Testing

- Mythara undergoes external penetration testing aligned with OWASP API Security Top 10 and NIST SP 800-53.
- Reports available to customers under NDA during procurement.
- Remediation timeline: Critical findings < 7 days; High < 30 days.

---

## Cryptographic Integrity

### Hash Algorithm

- **Current:** SHA-256 (NIST-approved, FIPS 140-2 compliant)
- **Collision Resistance:** ~2^128 operations (quantum-safe roadmap in progress)
- **Usage:** Per-invocation integrity hashes; signed manifests (PGP)

### Tamper Detection

- Every API response includes a cryptographic hash covering all mutable fields.
- Clients must recompute and verify hashes before trusting data.
- Mismatch triggers error and audit log entry.

### Comparison Safety

- All hash/token comparisons use constant-time algorithms (`hmac.compare_digest`) to prevent timing attacks.

---

## Input Validation

- **Framework:** Pydantic v2 with strict types and length limits
- **Clause Names:** Allowlist validation (no arbitrary strings accepted)
- **Unicode Handling:** Normalization (NFKC) applied to prevent lookalike bypasses
- **Injection Defense:** Parameterized queries; no eval/exec; escaped logging
- **Payload Limits:** 10 MB default (configurable); HTTP 413 on oversize

---

## SSIP Enforcement

- Required fields (clause, input) enforced via Pydantic schemas.
- SSIP metrics computed and logged on every invocation.
- Fallback to Shadow Resolver on validation failure with audit trail.
- No silent failures; all errors logged and returned to client.

---

## Replay and Race Prevention

- **Invocation IDs:** Unique, monotonic, with timestamp.
- **Deduplication:** (Recommended in production) Track seen IDs in Redis/DB with TTL.
- **Atomicity:** Unique constraints on ID storage prevent race conditions.

---

## Audit and Compliance

### Audit Logs

- Append-only, structured JSON (no user-controlled formatting)
- Stored in WORM-capable storage (configurable)
- PGP-signed manifests for tamper-evidence
- Retention aligns with regulatory requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, MDR, etc.)

### Compliance Mappings

- **NIST AI RMF:** Govern, Map, Measure controls
- **EU AI Act:** Transparency, audit trail, safety documentation
- **OWASP API Security Top 10:** Input validation, authentication, resource limits
- **ISO 27001:** A.14.2.5 (secure engineering), A.18.1.3 (records protection)
- **HIPAA/GDPR Art. 9:** Data minimization, integrity, audit (when handling PHI/special categories)

---

## Dependency Security

- All dependencies pinned in `requirements-api.txt`.
- Weekly automated scanning (`pip-audit`, GitHub Dependabot).
- Critical CVEs patched within 7 days; high within 30 days.
- Update testing in staging before production rollout.

---

## Network Security

- **TLS:** 1.3 only; strong cipher suites (configurable)
- **Authentication:** Bearer tokens (recommend 256-bit random keys, rotated every 90 days)
- **Rate Limiting:** Configurable per endpoint/IP/key to prevent abuse
- **Firewall:** Ingress restricted to known IPs where feasible

---

## Deployment Options

- **On-Premises:** Full control; no third-party data sharing
- **Private Cloud/VPC:** Isolation within customer infrastructure
- **Air-Gapped:** Supported for defense/critical infrastructure use cases

---

## Incident Response

- Security issues reported to: [Mythara.Engine@yahoo.com](mailto:Mythara.Engine@yahoo.com)
- Acknowledgment within 24 hours (business days)
- Remediation timeline: Critical < 7 days; High < 30 days; Medium < 90 days
- Coordinated disclosure with customers under active engagement

---

## Certifications and Standards (Roadmap)

- **Current:** OWASP alignment, NIST AI RMF mapping
- **In Progress:** SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001 certification
- **Planned:** FIPS 140-3 validation (cryptographic module), Common Criteria EAL4+

---

## Customer Access to Security Artifacts

Available under NDA during evaluation/procurement:

- Adversarial test suite source code and results
- Penetration test reports (redacted/anonymized)
- SSIP audit protocol documentation
- Compliance mapping matrices (NIST, EU AI Act, HIPAA, GDPR, ISO)

---

## Security Commitment

Mythara Engine is built for enterprise and regulated deployments where integrity, auditability, and safety are non-negotiable. We:

- Test adversarially on every release
- Respond rapidly to findings
- Maintain transparency with customers
- Align with industry standards and regulatory frameworks
