## Executive Summary

This report documents the security assessment of the Mythara Engine, a symbolic safety integrity protocol (SSIP) orchestration system. The evaluation focused on cryptographic integrity, input validation, SSIP enforcement, and resistance to common attack vectors.

**Key Findings:**
- [X] vulnerabilities identified ([X] critical, [X] high, [X] medium, [X] low)
- [X] hardening recommendations
- Overall security posture: [Strong / Acceptable / Needs Improvement]

---

## Scope and Methodology

### In Scope
- FastAPI endpoints (`/v1/clauses/*`, `/v1/reservoir/*`, `/v1/ssip/*`)
- Authentication (Bearer token validation)
- Integrity hash generation and verification
- SSIP validation logic
- Input sanitization and injection defenses
- Replay and race condition handling
- Audit log integrity

### Out of Scope
- Infrastructure (OS, network, cloud provider)
- Physical security
- Social engineering
- Third-party dependencies (unless exploited)

### Methodology
- OWASP API Security Top 10
- NIST SP 800-53 controls mapping
- Automated scanning (tools: [list])
- Manual exploitation attempts
- Code review (if white-box)

---

## Testing Environment

- Deployment: [Local / Staging / Production-like]
- API Version: v1.0.0
- Python: 3.11+
- FastAPI: 0.104+
- Test Duration: [X] days
- Tools Used: [Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, custom scripts, etc.]

---

## Findings

### 1. [Finding Title, e.g., "Insecure Hash Comparison"]

**Severity:** [Critical / High / Medium / Low / Informational]  
**CVSS Score:** [X.X]  
**Status:** [Open / Remediated / Risk Accepted]

**Description:**  
[Detailed explanation of the vulnerability, how it was discovered, and the attack vector.]

**Impact:**  
[What an attacker could achieve: data tampering, authentication bypass, denial of service, etc.]

**Affected Components:**  
- Endpoint: `/v1/clauses/invoke`
- Function: `verify_integrity_hash()`
- File: `core/source_proprietary/main.py:L234`

**Proof of Concept:**

```python
# Example exploit code or cURL command
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/clauses/invoke \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer WEAK_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"clause": "Guardian", "input": "malicious"}'
```

**Remediation:**

Replace string comparison with constant-time comparison:

```python
import hmac

# Before (vulnerable)
if hash_received == hash_expected:
    ...

# After (secure)
if hmac.compare_digest(hash_received, hash_expected):
    ...
```

**Verification:**  
[Test steps to confirm remediation; retest results.]

### 2. [Finding Title]

**Severity:** [...]  
**CVSS Score:** [...]  
**Status:** [...]

[Repeat structure for each finding...]

## Attack Scenarios Tested

| Scenario | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SQL Injection (clause name) | ✅ Blocked | Allowlist validation effective |
| Command Injection (input field) | ✅ Blocked | Pydantic strict types |
| Hash Collision Attack | ✅ Blocked | SHA-256 collision resistance |
| Replay Attack (reuse invocation ID) | ❌ Accepted | **Recommendation:** Add ID deduplication |
| Tampering Detection | ✅ Detected | Hash mismatch rejected |
| Oversized Payload (100 MB) | ✅ Rejected | HTTP 413 enforced |
| Unicode Bypass (lookalike chars) | ⚠️ Partial | **Recommendation:** Apply NFKC normalization |
| Timing Attack (hash comparison) | ❌ Vulnerable | **Recommendation:** Use `hmac.compare_digest` |
| SSIP Bypass (null clause) | ✅ Blocked | Pydantic required field validation |
| Race Condition (concurrent IDs) | ❌ Vulnerable | **Recommendation:** Atomic DB constraint |
| API Key Brute Force | ✅ Blocked | Rate limiting active |
| Log Injection (ANSI codes) | ⚠️ Partial | **Recommendation:** Escape user input in logs |

---

## Hardening Recommendations

### Critical

1. **Implement constant-time hash comparison**
   - Use `hmac.compare_digest()` for all hash/token checks
   - Priority: High
   - Effort: 1 hour

2. **Add invocation ID deduplication**
   - Track seen IDs in Redis/DB with TTL
   - Add unique constraint to prevent race conditions
   - Priority: High
   - Effort: 4 hours

### High

3. **Apply Unicode normalization (NFKC)**
   - Normalize all text inputs before validation
   - Priority: Medium
   - Effort: 2 hours

4. **Escape log output**
   - Sanitize user-controlled fields before logging
   - Use structured JSON logs only
   - Priority: Medium
   - Effort: 2 hours

### Medium

5. **Rotate API keys regularly**
   - Implement key rotation policy (90 days)
   - Priority: Medium
   - Effort: 8 hours (automation)

6. **Enable dependency scanning**
   - Add `pip-audit` to CI/CD
   - Subscribe to GitHub Dependabot alerts
   - Priority: Low
   - Effort: 1 hour

## Compliance Mapping

| Control | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| NIST AI RMF (Govern 1.1) | ✅ Met | SSIP audit logs present |
| OWASP API1 (Broken Object Level Authorization) | ✅ Met | Bearer token required |
| OWASP API2 (Broken Authentication) | ⚠️ Partial | Recommend key rotation |
| OWASP API4 (Unrestricted Resource Consumption) | ✅ Met | Payload size limits enforced |
| OWASP API8 (Security Misconfiguration) | ⚠️ Partial | Timing attack in hash comparison |
| ISO 27001 A.14.2.5 (Secure system engineering) | ✅ Met | Validation suite present |

---

## Conclusion

The Mythara Engine demonstrates a strong foundational security posture with effective input validation, cryptographic integrity checks, and SSIP enforcement. The primary areas for improvement are:

- Constant-time comparison for hash validation (timing attacks)
- Invocation ID deduplication to prevent replay attacks
- Unicode normalization to close bypass vectors

With the recommended remediations implemented, the system will meet industry-standard security expectations for deployment in regulated environments (financial services, healthcare, functional safety).

**Overall Rating:** [Strong / Acceptable / Needs Improvement]
