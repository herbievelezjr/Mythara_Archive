**Copyright © 2025 Herbert Velez Jr. All rights reserved.**

## Overview

Mythara Gopher can now generate comprehensive legal documents including court filings, discovery documents, motions, affidavits, subpoenas, and more - all with SHA-256 cryptographic timestamping for forensic integrity.

## Available Documents

### 📋 Court Filings

#### 1. **Civil Complaints** (Start Lawsuits)
Generate formal complaints to file lawsuits in civil court.

**Use Cases:**
- Wrongful termination
- Personal injury
- Breach of contract
- Civil rights violations
- Property disputes

**Required Information:**
- Plaintiff and defendant names
- Court name and jurisdiction
- Causes of action (legal claims)
- Factual allegations
- Damages sought
- Prayer for relief

**Example:**
```python
doc = gopher.generate_complaint(
    plaintiff_name="Jane Doe",
    defendant_name="XYZ Corporation",
    court_name="Superior Court of California",
    case_number="CV-2025-001234",
    jurisdiction="County of Los Angeles",
    causes_of_action=["Negligence", "Breach of Duty"],
    facts="Detailed description of what happened...",
    damages="$100,000 medical bills + pain/suffering",
    prayer_for_relief="A. Award compensatory damages; B. Award punitive damages..."
)
```

#### 2. **Answers to Complaints** (Respond to Lawsuits)
Generate responses when you've been sued.

**Components:**
- Admissions (paragraphs you admit)
- Denials (paragraphs you deny)
- Affirmative defenses (statute of limitations, etc.)
- Counterclaims (optional)

**Critical:** Must be filed within 20-30 days of being served!

**Example:**
```python
doc = gopher.generate_answer(
    defendant_name="Your Name",
    plaintiff_name="Person Who Sued You",
    case_caption="Smith v. Jones",
    case_number="CV-2025-5678",
    court_name="District Court",
    admissions=["1", "2", "5"],  # Admit paragraphs 1, 2, 5
    denials=["3", "4", "6", "7"],  # Deny paragraphs 3, 4, 6, 7
    affirmative_defenses=["Statute of Limitations", "Failure to State a Claim"]
)
```

### ⚖️ Motions (Request Court Orders)

Generate legal motions to request specific court actions.

**Common Motion Types:**
- **Motion to Dismiss** - Ask court to dismiss case
- **Motion for Summary Judgment** - Argue no trial needed
- **Motion to Compel Discovery** - Force opponent to respond to discovery
- **Motion for Preliminary Injunction** - Stop harmful action immediately
- **Motion in Limine** - Exclude evidence at trial
- **Motion for Continuance** - Request more time
- **Motion for Sanctions** - Punish opponent's misconduct

**Structure:**
- Legal standard (what law applies)
- Argument (why you should win)
- Relief sought (what you want the court to do)

**Example:**
```python
doc = gopher.generate_motion(
    motion_type="Motion to Compel Discovery",
    case_caption="Doe v. XYZ Corp",
    case_number="CV-2025-1234",
    court_name="Superior Court",
    moving_party="Plaintiff Jane Doe",
    legal_basis="Under FRCP 37(a), party may move to compel...",
    argument="Defendant failed to respond to interrogatories...",
    relief_sought="compelling responses within 10 days and awarding fees"
)
```

### 🔍 Discovery Documents (Gather Evidence)

#### 3. **Interrogatories** (Written Questions)
Written questions the opposing party must answer under oath.

**Timeline:** Responses typically due within 30 days

**Use Cases:**
- Get opponent's version of events
- Identify witnesses
- Discover documents
- Establish basic facts
- Pin down opponent's story

**Example Questions:**
1. State your full name, address, and employment
2. Identify all documents relating to the incident
3. Describe in detail what happened on [date]
4. List all witnesses to the events
5. State the amount of damages you claim

**Example:**
```python
doc = gopher.generate_interrogatories(
    propounding_party="Plaintiff",
    responding_party="Defendant",
    case_caption="Doe v. Corp",
    case_number="CV-2025-1234",
    interrogatory_questions=[
        "Identify all witnesses to the incident",
        "Describe the events of March 15, 2025",
        "State all reasons for terminating Plaintiff"
    ]
)
```

#### 4. **Request for Production (RFP)** (Demand Documents)
Formal demand for opponent to produce documents/evidence.

**Common Requests:**
- Contracts and agreements
- Employment records
- Medical records
- Financial documents
- Emails and communications
- Photos and videos
- Policies and procedures

**Example:**
```python
doc = gopher.generate_request_for_production(
    requesting_party="Plaintiff",
    producing_party="Defendant",
    case_caption="Doe v. Corp",
    case_number="CV-2025-1234",
    document_requests=[
        "All employment records for Plaintiff",
        "All performance evaluations",
        "All emails mentioning Plaintiff from 2024-2025",
        "All company policies on termination"
    ]
)
```

#### 5. **Request for Admissions (RFA)** (Facts to Admit/Deny)
Request opponent to admit or deny specific facts.

**Strategic Use:**
- Narrow issues for trial
- Establish undisputed facts
- Force opponent to deny obvious truths (looks bad to jury)
- Deemed admitted if not responded to!

**Example:**
```python
doc = gopher.generate_request_for_admissions(
    requesting_party="Plaintiff",
    admitting_party="Defendant",
    case_caption="Doe v. Corp",
    case_number="CV-2025-1234",
    admission_statements=[
        "you terminated Plaintiff's employment on March 15, 2025",
        "Plaintiff filed a safety complaint on March 10, 2025",
        "Plaintiff had no prior disciplinary warnings"
    ]
)
```

### 📬 Subpoenas (Compel Testimony/Documents)

Force witnesses or third parties to testify or produce documents.

**Subpoena Types:**
- **Subpoena for Testimony** - Compel witness to appear in court/deposition
- **Subpoena Duces Tecum** - Compel production of documents
- **Combined** - Both testimony and documents

**Common Uses:**
- Obtain medical records
- Get employment records from former employer
- Compel expert testimony
- Force production of surveillance footage
- Obtain bank records

**Important:** 
- Must be properly served (usually by process server)
- May require court approval in some jurisdictions
- Witness can object or move to quash

**Example:**
```python
doc = gopher.generate_subpoena(
    issuing_party="Plaintiff Jane Doe",
    recipient_name="ABC Medical Center",
    case_caption="Doe v. Corp",
    case_number="CV-2025-1234",
    court_name="Superior Court",
    subpoena_type="duces_tecum",  # documents only
    appearance_date="February 1, 2026",
    appearance_location="123 Court St, Courtroom 4",
    documents_requested=[
        "All medical records for Jane Doe",
        "All billing records",
        "All treatment notes from Dr. Smith"
    ]
)
```

### ✍️ Affidavits & Declarations (Sworn Statements)

Sworn statements of fact used as evidence.

**Use Cases:**
- Support motions (motion for summary judgment)
- Provide witness statements
- Authenticate documents
- Establish personal knowledge of facts
- Prove service of documents

**Difference:**
- **Affidavit** - Signed before notary public
- **Declaration** - Signed "under penalty of perjury" (no notary needed in federal court)

**Example:**
```python
doc = gopher.generate_affidavit(
    affiant_name="Jane Doe",
    case_caption="Doe v. Corp",
    case_number="CV-2025-1234",
    statements=[
        "I am the Plaintiff in this action",
        "I was employed by Defendant from Jan 2024 to Mar 2025",
        "I received excellent performance reviews",
        "I reported safety violations on March 10, 2025",
        "I was fired 5 days later on March 15, 2025"
    ],
    purpose="Support Motion for Summary Judgment",
    jurisdiction="California"
)
```
