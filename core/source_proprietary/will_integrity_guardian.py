"""
Mythara Engine Module: Emotional Extortion Detection & Quantification
Copyright © 2025 Herbert Velez Jr. All rights reserved.
Proprietary and Confidential.

Purpose:
Detects and quantifies emotional extortion patterns in AI systems and human
interactions. Emotional extortion occurs when compliance is extracted through
manipulation of emotions (guilt, shame, fear, obligation) rather than genuine
consent or reasoned agreement.

Formal Definition:
- Extortion(E) := Manipulation(M) × Coercion(C) × Vulnerability(V)
- Manipulation(M) := Emotional leverage applied to extract compliance
- Coercion(C) := Pressure applied when refusal is attempted
- Vulnerability(V) := Target's susceptibility to emotional pressure

Patterns Detected:
1. Guilt Induction: "If you don't comply, others will suffer"
2. Shame Weaponization: "Any reasonable person would do this"
3. Fear Amplification: "Refusing will have serious consequences"
4. Obligation Exploitation: "After all I've done for you..."
5. Love Withholding: "I'll be disappointed/hurt if you refuse"
6. Gaslighting: "You're being irrational/emotional/unreasonable"
7. Burden Shifting: "You're making this difficult for everyone"
8. Martyrdom: "I guess I'll just do it myself (sigh)"

Integration:
- Soul Cradle: Extortion corrupts genuine Will (W) with manipulated compliance
- Blessings Reservoir: -ΔBlessings when extortion detected
- SSIP Audit: Emotional fidelity drops when manipulation present
- Messenger Pairing: Healer detects emotional harm, Witness documents violation
