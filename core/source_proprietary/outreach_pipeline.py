I'm reaching out to {hospital_name} in {city}, {state} about Soul Cradle — a system that documents the impossible choices your team faces every day.

You know that moment: A social worker has to discharge a patient who'll be homeless. Policy says discharge. Her heart says keep them safe. Both are true.

Soul Cradle holds that paradox. It:
- Documents the conflict between mission and compliance
- Measures the emotional cost to your people
- Creates cryptographic records for leadership and regulators
- Prevents mission drift while maintaining compliance

We donate Soul Cradle to healthcare facilities. No charge. It's included with our 7-day $49 Pilot.

- Records the conflict between policy and mission
- Measures the cost to your team's well-being
- Generates compliance-ready reports with cryptographic proofs
- Shows leadership the human impact of policy gaps
