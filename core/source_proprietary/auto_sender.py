I'm Herbert Velez Jr., founder of Mythara Labs. I'm reaching out to {hospital_name} in {city}, {state} because your team carries a weight most people never see.

A social worker has to discharge a patient who'll be homeless. Policy says discharge. Her heart says keep them safe. She's not wrong either way—but she carries that paradox alone.

Soul Cradle exists for moments like this. It:
• Documents the impossible choice between mission and compliance
• Measures the emotional cost to your people (before it becomes burnout)
• Creates cryptographically verified records for leadership and auditors
• Shows regulators the human impact of policy gaps

Here's what matters: Soul Cradle is FREE for healthcare workers who need it most.

Your team saves lives every day. They shouldn't have to carry these paradoxes alone. Soul Cradle holds that weight.

I'm Herbert Velez Jr., founder of Mythara Labs. I'm reaching out to {bank_name} in {city}, {state} because your people face impossible moments that never make it into compliance reports.

A banker sees a family drowning financially. Knows exactly what would help. Policy says no. The family walks out. The banker carries that.

This isn't about breaking rules—it's about documenting the human cost when policy conflicts with mission.

Soul Cradle:
• Records the conflict between regulations and helping customers
• Measures the toll on your team (before it becomes attrition)
• Generates cryptographically verified compliance reports
• Shows leadership where policy creates impossible choices

Here's what matters: Soul Cradle helps your people prove they followed policy while documenting the cost. So when leadership asks "Why are we losing good bankers?", you have the data.

I'm Herbert Velez Jr., founder of Mythara Labs. I'm reaching out to {agency_name} because your people carry an impossible burden: serving the public while enforcing policies that sometimes hurt the very people they're trying to help.

A case worker knows a family desperately needs help. Regulation says they don't qualify. Both are true. The family leaves. The case worker stays—and carries that weight.

This happens every day in public service. And it's why burnout in government is a crisis.

Soul Cradle exists for this:
• Documents the conflict between policy and mission
• Measures the emotional toll on your team (before they quit)
• Creates audit-ready records showing you followed protocol
• Gives leadership data on where regulations conflict with public good

Here's what matters: Soul Cradle is FREE for government agencies and public servants.

Your people chose public service to help others. They shouldn't burn out doing it. Soul Cradle holds the paradox so they don't have to carry it alone.

Orders say one thing. Conscience says another. Both are valid. The service member makes the call—and carries that paradox for the rest of their life.

This is why veteran suicide rates are what they are. The impossible choices don't end when the mission does.

Soul Cradle exists for this:
• Documents operational paradoxes with cryptographic integrity
• Measures psychological impact on personnel (before it becomes PTSD)
• Creates audit-ready records for chain of command
• Maintains OPSEC while documenting ethical complexity

Here's what matters: Soul Cradle helps your people document that they followed orders while acknowledging the weight of impossible choices. So when they come home, they're not carrying it alone.
